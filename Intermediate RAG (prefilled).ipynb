      "According to this view, REM sleep is characterised by an emotional, vivid, and bizarre ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù mentation (Antrobus, 1983; Casagrande et al., 1996; Foulkes, 1967; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983; Waterman et al., 1993), while NREM mental activity would be ‚Äúthought-like‚Äù, with reduced emotional load, greater fragmentation, and contents more similar to waking thoughts (Foulkes, 1967; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the existence of a clear-cut REM-NREM dichotomy has been questioned also in this case based on several findings: (a) ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù reports have been observed also after NREM sleep (Monroe et al., 1965; Solms, 2000; Zimmerman, 1970) and (b) the qualitative differences between REM and NREM dream reports disappear when their length is equated (Antrobus, 1983; Cavallero et al., 1992; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983).\n",

      "In light of these observations, the assumption that the presence/ absence and the phenomenological aspects of dream experiences strictly depend on the sleep stage per se is simplistic.\n",

      "It is worth not- ing that a precise definition of the time-coupling between the sleep stages and the actual occurrence of dream experience is difficult, as the access to sleep mentation is possible only in an indirect way through dream reports after the awakening (see the paragraph ‚ÄúWhat about direct access to dream experience?‚Äù).\n",

Beyond the influence of trait-like factors, a growing number of studies also point to the role of the physiological milieu associated with the oneiric experience (state-like factors). In other words, the specific regional features of the physiological background contingent with dreaming would facilitate or prevent dream recall, potentially explaining intra-individual differences in dream reports.

On the other hand, a growing number of within-subject investiga- tions (which allows overcoming the possible influence of stable trait- like factors) show that a more desynchronised EEG pattern is associ- ated with dream recall in both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari  et al., 2017; D'Atri et al. 2019; Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; but see Wong et al., 2020). In particular, dream experi- ence would be facilitated by a pattern of reduced slow-wave activity (SWA), most steadily in posterior regions (Siclari et al., 2017, 2018). Interestingly, lucid dreams, phenomenon characterised by conscious awareness during the oneiric experience, appear associated with greater EEG gamma activity (Baird et al., 2022; Voss et al., 2009). Fur- thermore, a transcranial current stimulation delivered in a lower gamma range during REM sleep can affect the ongoing electrophysio- logical activity and increase self-reflective awareness in dreams (Voss et al., 2014). These observations are consistent with ‚Äúactivation‚Äù the- oretical models (Antrobus, 1991; Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Koulack & Goodenough, 1976), which postulate that dream recall would be facilitated by a greater level of arousal during sleep, repre- sented at an electrophysiological level by higher brain activation. Indeed, the frequency of dream recall increases in association with a sleep pattern characterised by greater sleep fragmentation (van Wyk et al., 2019), faster spindles, especially in central and posterior cor- tical areas (Siclari et al., 2018), intra-sleep wakefulness (De Gennaro et al., 2010; Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Vallat et al., 2017), and sleep arousal (Polini et al., 2017; Schredl, 2009). Furthermore, a night of recovery sleep after a period of prolonged wakefulness, usually characterised by reduced awakenings, almost totally abolished dream recall after the final morning awakening (De Gennaro et al., 2010). The SWA represents a marker of sleep intensity (Borb√©ly & Achermann, 1999), likely subserving the fading of consciousness during sleep. Thus, the pattern of local SWA reduction in association with dreaming activity may represent the electrophysiological marker of the greater arousal level needed for a successful dream recall. Moreover, this evidence provides a reli- able explanation for the apparently paradoxical occurrence of dreams in states of consciousness (i.e, REM and NREM sleep) characterised by drastically different EEG patterns.

      "On the other hand, a growing number of within-subject investiga- tions (which allows overcoming the possible influence of stable trait- like factors) show that a more desynchronised EEG pattern is associ- ated with dream recall in both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari  et al., 2017; D'Atri et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "2019; Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; but see Wong et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, dream experi- ence would be facilitated by a pattern of reduced slow-wave activity (SWA), most steadily in posterior regions (Siclari et al., 2017, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, lucid dreams, phenomenon characterised by conscious awareness during the oneiric experience, appear associated with greater EEG gamma activity (Baird et al., 2022; Voss et al., 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fur- thermore, a transcranial current stimulation delivered in a lower gamma range during REM sleep can affect the ongoing electrophysio- logical activity and increase self-reflective awareness in dreams (Voss et al., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "These observations are consistent with ‚Äúactivation‚Äù the- oretical models (Antrobus, 1991; Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Koulack & Goodenough, 1976), which postulate that dream recall would be facilitated by a greater level of arousal during sleep, repre- sented at an electrophysiological level by higher brain activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the frequency of dream recall increases in association with a sleep pattern characterised by greater sleep fragmentation (van Wyk et al., 2019), faster spindles, especially in central and posterior cor- tical areas (Siclari et al., 2018), intra-sleep wakefulness (De Gennaro et al., 2010; Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Vallat et al., 2017), and sleep arousal (Polini et al., 2017; Schredl, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, a night of recovery sleep after a period of prolonged wakefulness, usually characterised by reduced awakenings, almost totally abolished dream recall after the final morning awakening (De Gennaro et al., 2010).\n",
      "\n",
      "The SWA represents a marker of sleep intensity (Borb√©ly & Achermann, 1999), likely subserving the fading of consciousness during sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the pattern of local SWA reduction in association with dreaming activity may represent the electrophysiological marker of the greater arousal level needed for a successful dream recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, this evidence provides a reli- able explanation for the apparently paradoxical occurrence of dreams in states of consciousness (i.e, REM and NREM sleep) characterised by drastically different EEG patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these findings highlight the crucial role of the physiologi- cal state preceding dream recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, several questions remain open.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the influence of circadian and homeostatic factors on the oneiric experience and its electrophysiological pattern is not clear (Chellappa et al., 2011; D'Atri et al., 2019; Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the impact of the regional distribu- tion of SWA on qualitative dream facets needs to be fully investi- gated, as empirical preliminary evidence has been provided only by Siclari et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2017).\n",

Early cognitively-oriented studies focussed on the continuity between dream contents and waking events, personal concerns, thoughts, behaviours, and emotions, suggesting that waking-life expe- riences are reflected into subsequent dreams (Nielsen & Powell, 1992; Schredl, 2006; Blagrove, 2011; Vallat et al., 2017). Compelling evi- dence also showed the key role of the personal and emotional salience in mediating the preferential incorporation of waking-life aspects during mental sleep activity (Malinowski & Horton, 2014).  Further, different time intervals between waking experiences and related dream contents could represent ‚Äúday-residue effect‚Äù or ‚Äúdream-lag effect‚Äù as a function of the elapsed period (ie, 1-2 days and 5-7 days, respectively) (Eichenlaub et al., 2017). Specifically, the delayed incorporation of waking life events (‚Äúdream-lag effect‚Äù) was selectively observed during REM sleep and for personally significant events (Van Rijn et al., 2015).  A complementary field of study posits the continuity between waking state and mental sleep activity from a neurophysiological per- spective. Namely, a growing body of evidence suggests that brain mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional functioning remain the same across different states of consciousness (e.g., Marzano et al., 2011; Eichenalub et al., 2018).  The involvement of alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (5-7 Hz) oscilla- tions in memory-related neural processes during wakefulness are well-established, especially as regards episodic-declarative memory (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, the increase in the frontal theta activity and the alpha power decrease during the encoding phase of episodic memories were found to play a pivotal role in the subsequent recall of stored information (Hsieh & Ranganath, 2014; Klimesch, 1999).  Over the last two decades, several studies were conducted under the assumption that dream encoding and recall could represent a peculiar form of episodic memory (Fosse et al., 2003). As previously mentioned, a successful dream recall has been linked to higher frontal theta activity during REM sleep (Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015) and lower alpha activity over the temporo-parietal region during NREM (Esposito et al., 2004; Marzano et al., 2011; Takeuchi et al., 2003). Moreover, the topographical distribution of the above- mentioned frequency bands resembles brain regions involved in encoding and retrieval mechanisms during wakefulness.  A large body of experimental studies have also shown the conti- nuity between dreaming and emotional processing (for a review, see Scarpelli et al., 2019c). First of all, as described in the previous para- graph, neuroimaging studies showed the relationship between qualita- tive and quantitative stable aspects of dream experience and structural parameters of limbic areas (De Gennaro et al., 2011).

Further, the main brain circuits involved in emotional processing during wake are highly activated during REM sleep, such as the limbic system (Nir & Tononi, 2010) and  reward system (Perogamvros & Schwartz, 2012). Notably, a recent simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging study dem- onstrated the privileged re-emergence during sleep of patterns of brain activity associated with a recent rewarding (compared to a non- rewarding) waking experience during sleep (Sterpenich et al., 2021).  Starting from these findings, many researchers stated that dream activity might have a crucial role in processing emotional events expe- rienced during wakefulness (see Scarpelli et al., 2019c). More in- depth, the theta (Nishida et al., 2009; Boyce et al., 2016; Sopp et al., 2018) and gamma activities (Van Der Helm et al., 2011) were identified as the EEG markers of emotional memory processing. Selec- tive sleep deprivation protocols provided experimental evidence about the lack of emotional memories consolidation in the absence of REM sleep stage (Spoormaker et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2001), supporting the notion that dreaming represents the privileged sce- nario for the offline reprocessing of waking emotional stimuli.  Keeping in mind the unitary perspective across waking and sleep state, several investigations aimed to overcome the boundaries between different states of consciousness directly influencing sleep mentation by different kinds of sensory stimuli administered pre- or during sleep. Pre-sleep stimulation methods have been used since the very beginning of dream research. The pioneering study by Dement and Wolpert (1958) showed the relation between the 24-h fluid restriction in participants and their subsequent REM dream content. Sensory stimulation through pre-sleep visual stimuli affected dream content by using stressful films (Goodenough et al., 1965) or visual inverting prisms (Corsi-Cabrera et al., 1986).  Concerning sensory stimulation delivered during REM or NREM sleep stages, early studies described the incorporation of meaning ver- bal stimuli (Berger, 1963; Hoelscher et al., 1981).

As expected, these types of stimulation increased vividness and bodily sensation in the dream contents.  Recent studies using olfactory stimulation during sleep showed the influence on the emotional content of dreams as a function of the hedonic characteristic of stimuli (Schredl et al., 2009) and the reac- tivation of the odour-associated images (Schredl et al., 2014). The strong effect of olfactory stimulation on dream emotional aspects is interpreted in terms of direct connections to the limbic system (Smith & Shepherd, 2003).  In the last few years, a promising field of research explored the shared neural circuits between wake and sleep mentation by directly manipulating dream activity via transcranial electrical stimulation tech- niques. Some studies showed that interfering with cortical areas that are notably involved in a specific function during wakefulness influenced the dream content accordingly (Jakobson et al., 2012; Noreika et al., 2020).

      "Early cognitively-oriented studies focussed on the continuity between dream contents and waking events, personal concerns, thoughts, behaviours, and emotions, suggesting that waking-life expe- riences are reflected into subsequent dreams (Nielsen & Powell, 1992; Schredl, 2006; Blagrove, 2011; Vallat et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Compelling evi- dence also showed the key role of the personal and emotional salience in mediating the preferential incorporation of waking-life aspects during mental sleep activity (Malinowski & Horton, 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, different time intervals between waking experiences and related dream contents could represent ‚Äúday-residue effect‚Äù or ‚Äúdream-lag effect‚Äù as a function of the elapsed period (ie, 1-2 days and 5-7 days, respectively) (Eichenlaub et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, the delayed incorporation of waking life events (‚Äúdream-lag effect‚Äù) was selectively observed during REM sleep and for personally significant events (Van Rijn et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "A complementary field of study posits the continuity between waking state and mental sleep activity from a neurophysiological per- spective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namely, a growing body of evidence suggests that brain mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional functioning remain the same across different states of consciousness (e.g., Marzano et al., 2011; Eichenalub et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "The involvement of alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (5-7 Hz) oscilla- tions in memory-related neural processes during wakefulness are well-established, especially as regards episodic-declarative memory (Klimesch, 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, the increase in the frontal theta activity and the alpha power decrease during the encoding phase of episodic memories were found to play a pivotal role in the subsequent recall of stored information (Hsieh & Ranganath, 2014; Klimesch, 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last two decades, several studies were conducted under the assumption that dream encoding and recall could represent a peculiar form of episodic memory (Fosse et al., 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously mentioned, a successful dream recall has been linked to higher frontal theta activity during REM sleep (Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015) and lower alpha activity over the temporo-parietal region during NREM (Esposito et al., 2004; Marzano et al., 2011; Takeuchi et al., 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the topographical distribution of the above- mentioned frequency bands resembles brain regions involved in encoding and retrieval mechanisms during wakefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large body of experimental studies have also shown the conti- nuity between dreaming and emotional processing (for a review, see Scarpelli et al., 2019c).\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, as described in the previous para- graph, neuroimaging studies showed the relationship between qualita- tive and quantitative stable aspects of dream experience and structural parameters of limbic areas (De Gennaro et al., 2011).\n",
      "\n",
      "Con- sistently, subjects reporting higher levels of fear in their dreams showed a concomitant higher activation of the medial prefrontal cor- tex, responsible for reduced activation of the amygdala, insula, and midcingulate cortex both during sleep and wakefulness (Phelps et al., 2004; Sterpenich et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the main brain circuits involved in emotional processing during wake are highly activated during REM sleep, such as the limbic system (Nir & Tononi, 2010) and  reward system (Perogamvros & Schwartz, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, a recent simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging study dem- onstrated the privileged re-emergence during sleep of patterns of brain activity associated with a recent rewarding (compared to a non- rewarding) waking experience during sleep (Sterpenich et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting from these findings, many researchers stated that dream activity might have a crucial role in processing emotional events expe- rienced during wakefulness (see Scarpelli et al., 2019c).\n",
      "\n",
      "More in- depth, the theta (Nishida et al., 2009; Boyce et al., 2016; Sopp et al., 2018) and gamma activities (Van Der Helm et al., 2011) were identified as the EEG markers of emotional memory processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selec- tive sleep deprivation protocols provided experimental evidence about the lack of emotional memories consolidation in the absence of REM sleep stage (Spoormaker et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2001), supporting the notion that dreaming represents the privileged sce- nario for the offline reprocessing of waking emotional stimuli.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping in mind the unitary perspective across waking and sleep state, several investigations aimed to overcome the boundaries between different states of consciousness directly influencing sleep mentation by different kinds of sensory stimuli administered pre- or during sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pre-sleep stimulation methods have been used since the very beginning of dream research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pioneering study by Dement and Wolpert (1958) showed the relation between the 24-h fluid restriction in participants and their subsequent REM dream content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory stimulation through pre-sleep visual stimuli affected dream content by using stressful films (Goodenough et al., 1965) or visual inverting prisms (Corsi-Cabrera et al., 1986).\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning sensory stimulation delivered during REM or NREM sleep stages, early studies described the incorporation of meaning ver- bal stimuli (Berger, 1963; Hoelscher et al., 1981).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, somatosensory stimulation (e.g., water on the skin, thermal stimulation, pressure cuff, electrical pulses) (Baldridge et al., 1965; Dement & Wolpert, 1958; Koulack, 1969; Nielsen, 1993) or vestibular stimulation (Leslie & Ogilvie, 1996) were found to affect dream content.\n",
      "\n",
      "As expected, these types of stimulation increased vividness and bodily sensation in the dream contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies using olfactory stimulation during sleep showed the influence on the emotional content of dreams as a function of the hedonic characteristic of stimuli (Schredl et al., 2009) and the reac- tivation of the odour-associated images (Schredl et al., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong effect of olfactory stimulation on dream emotional aspects is interpreted in terms of direct connections to the limbic system (Smith & Shepherd, 2003).\n",

However, the intrinsic restraint due to the impossibility of directly investigating the dream content represents a common limi-  tation of these studies.  1.4 | What about direct access to dream experience?  The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address. Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself.

These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).

Generally, participants are awakened to explore the presence of a dream report and to compare the recall and non-recall condition (Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Siclari et al., 2017) or the report's qualitative features (Scarpelli et al., 2020b), correlating them with the specific EEG patterns preceding the awakening. It is worth noting that the narration of dream contents could be influenced by many biases after awakenings, such as the experimental setting (Schredl, 2008), the physiological background of waking-life and by individual variables, such as personality, cognitive functions, censure/ omissions and socio-cultural features (Nir & Tononi, 2010), making dream reports not always completely reliable.  How can we overcome this obstacle? In this regard, recent studies have suggested that viable access to mental sleep activity is represen- ted by dream-enacting behaviours (DEBs; Baltzan et al., 2020). Any acting out of a dream during sleep characterised by motor, emotional or verbal components may be considered a direct observation of dream experience while the subject is asleep (Nielsen et al., 2009). In this view, the study of parasomnias or parasomnia-like events, ie., REM behaviour disorder (RBD), sleep walking, nightmares, and sleep talking, may provide new insights about dreaming. Interestingly,  some investigations highlighted a strong level of congruence between  the body movements, verbal or emotional expressions during sleep and the subsequent components of dream recall (Arkin et al., 1970; Leclair-Visonneau et al., 2010; Oudiette et al., 2009; Rocha & Arnulf, 2020).  Assessing REMs in patients with RBD, Leclair-Visonneau et al. (2010) found a concordance between limbs, head, and eye movements during the REM behaviour episode. The authors suggested that REMs may imitate the scanning of the dream scenario according to the so-called ‚Äúscanning hypothesis‚Äù (Arnulf, 2011; Leclair-Visonneau et al., 2010). Moreover, Oudiette et al. (2009) rev- ealed that during sleepwalking or sleep terror episodes, subjects show complex motor behaviours strictly related to their oneiric scenes. The same group has demonstrated that sleepwalkers are able to replay the recently trained behaviour during the parasomnia episode, supporting the idea that dream enactment may have a pivotal role in memory processing during sleep (Oudiette et al., 2011).  More recently, Rivera-Garcia et al. (2019) investigated the activa- tion of facial muscles during REM sleep among healthy women. They considered facial expressions during sleep on a par with DEBs and an index of emotional dreams. Consistently, the previous literature shows that DEBs are more frequent during intense emotional dreams, such as nightmares (Nielsen et al., 2009). Indeed, the authors revealed that the activation of corrugator and zygomatic muscles are highly associated with dreams featured by negative affect (Rivera-Garcia et al. (2019)).  Also, sleep talking could be considered an additional non- pathological parasomnia-like event related to dreaming (Alfonsi et al., 2019; Mangiaruga et al., 2021). During sleep, the audible ver- balisations may represent access to oneiric contents (Arkin et al., 1970; Alfonsi et al., 2019). In this regard, some studies showed different degrees of correspondence between sleep talking and dreaming (Arkin et al., 1970; Rechtschaffen et al., 1962). Arkin et al. (1970) reported different orders of concordance between sleep speech and later dream reports. Some authors investigated the pres- ence of dialogical components within the dream reports proposing an overlapping between the neural mechanisms underlying linguistic pro- duction in dreams and those responsible for language during waking state (Shimizu & Inoue, 1986; Hong et al., 1996; Siclari et al., 2017). Specifically, Hong et al. (1996) found a reduction of the alpha activity focussed on Broca's and Wernicke's language regions, proportional to the amount of expressive and receptive language reported in dreams (Hong et al., 1996; Shimizu & Inoue, 1986). In addition, Noreika et al. (2015) demonstrated a decrement in the theta and alpha activity in a single-case study associated with linguistic hypnagogic hallucina- tion. Consistently, a recent study revealed that similar EEG patterns predict intelligible verbalisations during sleep (Mangiaruga et al., 2022).  Overall, both findings in subjects suffering from parasomnias and those related to ‚Äúbenign‚Äù phenomena (e.g., facial expressions, sleep talking), suggest that parasomnia-like episodes may open a new frontier in dream research making the oneiric production more  accessible.        wos} PapHO[UMOG \"F ‚ÄúZZOZ ‚Äú698TSIEL     LOT opywos:Kaptav-Kreaquyar     -IGET OUNTUO AAIEAA ‚Äú6O9E     g S 8 ¬ß 2 & 5     puoo-pur-suus9} (1109      jn x0y Aaeaqny auyUG A2qtyy     8 & < ¬∞ 2 3 = \f",

      "The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the most accurate approach is represented by the provoked awakenings associated with the polysomnography (PSG) of one or more sleep nights in a labora- tory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, participants are awakened to explore the presence of a dream report and to compare the recall and non-recall condition (Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Siclari et al., 2017) or the report's qualitative features (Scarpelli et al., 2020b), correlating them with the specific EEG patterns preceding the awakening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that the narration of dream contents could be influenced by many biases after awakenings, such as the experimental setting (Schredl, 2008), the physiological background of waking-life and by individual variables, such as personality, cognitive functions, censure/ omissions and socio-cultural features (Nir & Tononi, 2010), making dream reports not always completely reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we overcome this obstacle?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, recent studies have suggested that viable access to mental sleep activity is represen- ted by dream-enacting behaviours (DEBs; Baltzan et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "Any acting out of a dream during sleep characterised by motor, emotional or verbal components may be considered a direct observation of dream experience while the subject is asleep (Nielsen et al., 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this view, the study of parasomnias or parasomnia-like events, ie., REM behaviour disorder (RBD), sleep walking, nightmares, and sleep talking, may provide new insights about dreaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly,  some investigations highlighted a strong level of congruence between  the body movements, verbal or emotional expressions during sleep and the subsequent components of dream recall (Arkin et al., 1970; Leclair-Visonneau et al., 2010; Oudiette et al., 2009; Rocha & Arnulf, 2020).\n",

      "6 of 12 Pies     SCARPELLI er AL.        14.1 | Nightmares  Nightmares are disturbing mental sleep activity characterised by nega- tive emotions and often considered a clinical symptom causing signifi- cant distress. They are frequently associated with a high level of arousal and somatic manifestations that are capable to awake the dreamer from REM sleep. The repeated occurrence of this event is categorised as parasomnia, i.e., ‚Äúnightmare disorder‚Äù, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013).  On the one hand, this disturbance is frequently related to post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Germain, 2013), but it could also be a reaction to stress conditions (Scarpelli et al., 2022). On the other hand, also idiopathic nightmares, i.e., without a known cause, should be con- sidered. For instance, this kind of mental sleep activity is quite com- mon in children tending to disappear during adulthood, and it is more frequent among females (Nielsen & Levin, 2007).  From a neurobiological perspective, a recent investigation shows that the activation of the autonomic nervous system may be linked to nightmares (Paul et al., 2019). Some studies revealed REM-specific alterations in nightmare sufferers such as longer REM latency, increased skipping of early REM periods and cycle length, and more frequent REM periods (Nielsen et al., 2010). Furthermore, some EEG findings highlighted the presence of slow frontal and central theta activity during REM sleep in a group of nightmare recallers (Marquis et al, 2017). Further studies reported evidence for reduced slow- wave sleep and greater intra-sleep wakefulness (Simor et al., 2012), increased alpha power during REM sleep, and higher levels of EEG desynchronisation in NREM sleep of students with frequent night- mares (Simor et al., 2013). In other words, as already mentioned for dream recall, a higher autonomic and electrophysiological activation may provide the physiological background to the nightmare occur- rence (Fisher et al., 1970; Nielsen & Zadra, 2005). This is consistent with the self-reported experience of greater emotional and physical activations during the nightmare occurrence.  Fear is the predominant emotion included in nightmares (Zadra et al., 2006), suggesting that nightmares could be linked to fear- dysfunction disturbances, i.e., phobias, generalised or social anxiety (Nielsen & Levin, 2007; Walker, 2010). In other words, nightmares could be related to the dysfunction in the hippocampal-amygdala pre- frontal system that controls fear memory formation and extinction (Marquis et al., 2017; Nielsen & Levin, 2007). Nevertheless, the func- tional role of nightmares is still debated. Considering the early theo- ries of dream function emphasising roles for REM sleep and dreaming in promoting adaptation to stress, nightmares could be interpreted as a failure of this process (Wright & Koulack, 1987).  Along this vein, some authors proposed that a certain degree of awareness of our dream contents and the possibility of altering them may be beneficial for nightmares sufferers (Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001; Neidhardt et al., 1992). In particular, compelling evidence highlighted that imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is very effective in reducing chronic nightmares within 6-12 weeks of ther- apy (Germain et al., 2004; Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001;  Neidhardt et al., 1992). This technique consists of modifying the plot of the recurring nightmare during the wakefulness by an imaginal rehearsal of a new dream without disturbing items (Kellner et al., 1992). The nightmare sufferers learn to change the nightmares scenes by creating a less unpleasant ending and including mastery ele- ments in the new dream scenario (Germain et al., 2004).  Interestingly, lucid dreaming induction could represent a useful intervention to reduce nightmares (Zadra & Pihl, 1997; Spoormaker & Van Den Bout, 2006; Rak et al., 2015). It has been hypothesised that lucid dreaming could be a sort of coping strategy to face unpleasant stimuli during a dream experience (Schiappa et al., 2018). Actually, lucid dream therapy is a cognitive technique that allows patients to learn to be aware of and modify their mental sleep activity during their nightmares through daily exercises (Spoormaker & Van Den Bout, 2006; Zadra & Pihl, 1997).  More recently, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro, 1989) has been employed for nightmares treatment in PTSD. Starting from the view that nightmares are the manifesta- tions of adverse events registered in a dysfunctional form, this tech- nique aimed to promote the recall of distressing images while activating one type of bilateral sensory input (e.g., hand tapping or side-to-side eye movement). The protocol allows subjects to identify and reprocess the targeted disturbing memories and experiences in order to formulate insight and adaptive behaviour.  In conclusion, it should be underlined that studies on PSG abnor- malities and specific macro- and micro-structural features correlated to nightmares are still missing. Further, efficacy studies on nightmare treatment (i.e., IRT, lucid dream therapy, EMDR) are scarce and frag- mentary. Future research should be conducted to fill this gap and explore the effectiveness of the above-mentioned interventions for  nightmare disorders.  1.4.2 | What role for dreamwork in modern psychotherapy?  An interesting open issue concerns the possible usefulness of the oneiric experience as a tool in clinical practice, also in light of the neu- roscientific knowledge on dreams.  Classically, Freud (1953) proposed two main functions of dreams: the expression of repressed infantile wishes and the protection of sleep. The antimoral nature of such wishes implies the need of a dis- tortion through the dream censor to be acceptable, allowing their par- tial expression while protecting the continuity of sleep. Freud distinguished the manifest and the latent content of dream, the latter containing the true meaning of the dream. Free associations would represent the ‚Äúroyal road‚Äù to uncover the latent dream content, and the analyst provide his/her dream interpretation on the basis of the patient's dynamics.  The role of dream interpretation in modern psychoanalytic models has been significantly redefined compared to the initial Freud- ian conceptualisation (Pesant & Zadra, 2004).

      "Furthermore, some EEG findings highlighted the presence of slow frontal and central theta activity during REM sleep in a group of nightmare recallers (Marquis et al, 2017).\n",

      "Further studies reported evidence for reduced slow- wave sleep and greater intra-sleep wakefulness (Simor et al., 2012), increased alpha power during REM sleep, and higher levels of EEG desynchronisation in NREM sleep of students with frequent night- mares (Simor et al., 2013).\n",
      "\n",

Beck (1971) proposed that dreams reflect the individual conception (and biases) about the self, the world, and the future, and may represent and indi- cator of changes in the emotional status. Nevertheless, the initial need to move away from the psychoanalytical framework and the pressure to adopt an empirically verifiable clinical model led to a common dis- use of oneiric activity in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy. Dreams were mainly considered as psychologically meaningless epiphenomena of sleep, useless for the dreamer and in turn for the therapeutic pro- cess. More recently, the progress in the scientific understanding of dreams has led to the reintegration of dreams among the object of interest from different epistemological paradigms in the cognitivist framework. From a rationalist perspective, starting from the hypothe- sis that dreams are subjected to the same cognitive distortions that characterise the waking experience, it has been proposed that dreamwork can help to detect cognitive biases and maladaptive thought patterns (Barrett, 2002; Freeman & White, 2002; Hill, 1996, 2003) and promote cognitive reconstructing. On the other hand, the constructivist paradigm moved the focus on the narrative facets of dreams and the co-construction of meaning between patient and therapist (Bara, 2012; Rezzonico & Bani, 2015; Rosner et al., 2004), with the aim to promote the emergence of relevant aspects of the personal meaning and increase the level of awareness of the patient.  The interest in the clinical use of dreams led to the development of different articulated models of dreamwork in psychotherapy, like the Description, Memory Sources, and Reformulation (DMR) model (Montangero, 2009) and the cognitive-experiential model (Hill, 1996, 2003). Overall, Eudell-Simmons and Hilsenroth (2005) identify four main functions of dreams in psychotherapy: (a) facilitate the therapeu- tic process, (b) increase patient insight and self-awareness, (c) provide clinical information relevant for the therapist, and (d) provide a mea- sure of therapeutic change.  Clearly, a further research effort is needed to provide support for the objective and efficacy of dreamwork in psychotherapy. Neverthe- less, the ongoing debate on this topic has led to several models of the clinical valence of dreams that appear consistent with experimental findings on oneiric activity, mainly moving from standardised symbolic interpretations of dreams to approaches based on the relationship of dreaming with individual experience and cognitive/emotional/behav-  ioural functioning.  2 | CONCLUSIONS  From the discovery of REM sleep to the present day, empirical investi- gations have considerably increased our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying dream recall.  Although compelling evidence converges in providing support to the so-called activation hypothesis and continuity hypothesis, consid- erable efforts are still needed to fully understand the neurobiological bases of oneiric processes.  Overall, we believe that (a) some results are still heterogeneous due to the application of different protocols, so a more consistent approach is needed; (b) the use of advanced techniques such as high-density EEG or source localisation methods should be encour- aged to better understand the relationship between specific oscilla- tions and dream features; (c) further studies on experimental manipulation of dreaming should be carried out, also considering the implementation of brain stimulation techniques to promote dream recall or its specific characteristics; and (d) DEBs could be used as a model to observe dream contents overcoming the problem regarding the correspondence between specific time/stage of sleep and dream production, offering new insights about the neural correlate of dreaming.  Lastly, it is worth noting that recent pandemic studies have ‚Äúelec- ted‚Äù dream activity (and nightmares) as a reliable index of our emo- tional and psychological health (Frankl et al., 2021; Scarpelli et al., 2022). Considering this, we underline that a translational view is needed to systematically explore the potential role of neurobiological  and experiential facets of dreaming in a clinical context.

Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnos- tic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Associa- tion, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the rou- tine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and psycho- neurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep- wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/ restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive-behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines.

The European Academy for CBT-I has summarized prevalence data for ID across some European countries (Baglioni et al., 2020), varying strongly from country to country. Data for Germany indicate a prevalence of 5.7%, whereas French surveys indi- cate figures up to 20%. On average, approximately 10% of the adult European population suffer from chronic insomnia. The heterogenous data clearly stress the need for the prospective collection of pan-European samples with state-of-the-art methods to obtain the full picture for planning of insomnia healthcare services.  The costs of insomnia for the individual and society are stagger- ing: it was demonstrated that insomnia conveys increased risks for cardiovascular diseases (Li et al. 2014), obesity and diabetes (Anothaisintawee et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2018), depression (Baglioni et al, 2011; Hertenstein et al, 2019), anxiety (Hertenstein et al., 2019) and suicide (Pigeon et al., 2012). Wickwire (2019) reported that untreated insomnia leads to increased all-cause healthcare utilization based on a randomly selected and nationally representative sample from the USA.

      "consensus sleep diary by Carney et al., 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleep diaries are easy to apply and to evaluate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleep diaries focus on the experience of sleep and can be reviewed by the clinician as they are presented, but the inherent information can also be used to create highly informative graphical displays of sleep and bedtimes (Figure 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond sleep diaries, other insomnia-specific questionnaires like the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien et al., 2001) or the Sleep Condi- tion Indicator (Espie et al., 2014) should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "For both clinical and fundamental research, it is favourable to take note of the recommendations for a standard research assessment of insomnia (Buysse et al., 2006).\n",
      "\n",
      "Several paradigms were developed to elucidate specific aspects of insomnia, for example, the attentional bias paradigm (Espie et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "This paradigm suggests that patients with chronic insomnia have developed a bias in their perception and processing of stimuli related to insomnia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other highly promising paradigms investigate failing overnight amelioration of distress, which seems key to persistence of hyperarousal (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, not yet being ready for standard clinical practice, it is conceivable that these paradigms might be used in the future to measure responsiveness to CBT-I, also in combination with neuroimaging methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the diagnosis of insomnia is solely based on subjective com- plaints and their measurement, it remains a matter of long-standing debate what the role of technical methods like actigraphy or poly- somnography (PSG) might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a highly controversial issue as to whether PSG should be part of the diagnostic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtlessly PSG helps to unravel suspected occult pathology of sleep, that is, peri- odic limb movements during sleep (periodic limb movement disorder) or sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome).\n",
      "\n",
      "US guidelines clearly deny the usefulness of PSG to diagnose insomnia (Kushida et al., 2005), whereas guidelines of the German and the European Sleep Research Society (Riemann, Baum, et al., 2017; Riemann, Baglioni, et al., 2017) suggest that PSG be used for patients with therapy-refractory insomnia who have not responded to a previous adequate ‚Äúdose‚Äù of pharmaco- or psychotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frequently described discrepancy between subjective (i.e.\n",
      "\n",
      "data from sleep diaries) and objective data (PSG) called paradoxi- cal insomnia or sleep state misperception is seen as a major clinical and scientific challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "PSG contrasted with subjective data does not reveal as pronounced disturbances of sleep as indicated by subjective data (Feige et al., 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "A PSG meta-analysis revealed mean total sleep time differences between insomnia and good sleepers of about 25 min, whereas subjective estimates demonstrated an almost 2-hr difference (Baglioni, Regen, et al., 2014; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional PSG reveals only a glimpse of the brain activ- ity during sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced analyses have commenced to reveal elec- troencephalogram (EEG) correlates of subjective wakefulness during sleep, like simultaneous wake-like and sleep-like brain activity in peo- ple with insomnia (Christensen et al., 2019; Stephan et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, classification of individual insomnia patients based on their PSG and EEG power-spectral variables can distinguish between those with objective short sleep and those with sleep state mis- perception (Kao et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the ‚Äúmisperception‚Äù may in fact be ‚Äúmismeasurement‚Äù: an inappropriate use or interpretation of traditional PSG features by clinicians, rather than inappropriate inter- pretation of subjective experiences by people with insomnia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to bear in mind that these same challenges apply to mental disorders in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no objective ‚Äútest‚Äù for depression, anxi- ety or psychosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The validation of any such tests needs to apply self- report coupled with clinical judgement as the ‚Äúgold-standard.‚Äù Vgontzas and colleagues have postulated that the long-term health consequences of insomnia may be related specifically to objec- tive short sleep duration of less than 6 hr (Vgontzas et al., 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, patients with short sleep insomnia during one night do not fulfil that criteria on another night, and an increased risk of hyperten- sion in short sleeping insomnia could not be replicated (Johann et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the hypothesis that the presence of objectively documented short sleep may be of relevance for the choice of therapy (Riemann et al., 2011), that is, pharmacotherapy for insomnia patients with objective short sleep duration versus psychotherapy for insomnia patients with objective normal sleep duration, has yet to be resolved and deserves further consideration (Vgontzas et al., 2013).\n",

      "More details will be provided in the aetiology/pathophysiology section.\n",

      "The European Academy for CBT-I has summarized prevalence data for ID across some European countries (Baglioni et al., 2020), varying strongly from country to country.\n",

Data from the USA resulted in a sum of 150 billion US dollars for direct and indirect costs of insomnia (Reynolds & Ebben, 2017). A Canadian study (Daley et al., 2009) reported total annual costs for ID alone to be about 6.5 billion Canadian dollars. Recent data indicate that treatment using dig- ital CBT-I reduces healthcare expenditure, and Markov health eco- nomic modelling indicates that digital CBT-I| may be highly cost- effective when offered at scale (Darden et al., 2021). Further details of the costs and risks of insomnia are given in the European Academy for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia Report (Baglioni et al., 2020). An important clinical and research question relates to the hypothesis that adequate insomnia treatment might not only effec- tively target insomnia symptoms but might reduce subclinical and clin- ical psychopathology, and also be of general preventive value for  mental disorders and physical diseases.  3 | AETIOLOGICAL AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS  Recent reviews synthesized current neurobiological, cognitive, behav- ioural and emotional models for insomnia and its relationship to psy- chopathology (Figure 3; Espie, 2022; Riemann et al., 2020; Van Someren, 2021).  Current theoretical approaches span from cognitive-behavioural to neurobiological models, and models taking into account both levels simultaneously.  The basic structure of the model depicted in Figure 3 is taken from the so-called 3P model of insomnia (Spielman et al., 1987). The 3Ps signify: predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors.  ‚ÄúPredisposing‚Äù factors come from the areas of (epi-)genetics and early life stress that contribute to individual differences at the level of brain function and personality. Genetic and epigenetic factors have been shown to be involved in the aetiology of insomnia by family and twin studies (for an overview, see Palagini et al., 2014). Genome-wide association studies point to an involvement of a very large number of genes, each with a very small contribution, and shared genetic factors for insomnia and restless legs, cardiometabolic, and especially psychiat- ric traits Jansen et al., 2019; Lane et al., 2019). Interestingly, the brain tissues and cell types expressing sets of insomnia risk genes are not pri- marily part of the known circuitry regulating sleep but are rather part of circuitries involved in emotion regulation (Van Someren, 2021).  Still, for completeness, a discussion on the development and maintenance of insomnia should include the neurobiological mecha- nisms of sleep, notably homeostatic and biological time-keeping mechanisms (Borb√©ly, 1982). The flip-flop switch model of sleep regu- lation (Saper et al., 2005) suggests a bistable switch mechanism between sleep and wake promoting centres of neuronal cell groups. Wakefulness is governed by a network of cell populations in the hypothalamus (including orexinergic neurons), basal forebrain and brain stem, activating thalamus and cortical structures. These struc-  tures include and extend beyond the cell groups in the reticular  formation of the brainstem (originally described as ascending reticular activating system). The main sleep-inducing centres are located in the ventrolateral-preoptic nucleus (VLPO), which becomes active during sleep and inhibits all major wake-promoting centres in the hypothala- mus and brain stem, with the neurotransmitters galanin and gamma- aminobutyric acid. The VLPO receives afferent input from each of the major monoaminergic systems, and is inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin. A mutual inhibitory circuit between both systems, the wake and the sleep system, leads to a flip-flop switch with ‚Äúsharp‚Äù transi- tions between sleeping and waking. Thus, insomnia on this level can be conceptualized as imbalance between sleep-inducing and wake (i.e. arousal)-inducing mechanisms. A hyperactivity of the arousal sys- tem or a hypoactivity of the sleep system or both simultaneously could thus ‚Äúdrive‚Äù the insomnia. Circadian and homeostatic mecha- nisms are also involved in this switch process, and it has been specu- lated that a dysfunctional ‚Äúkey switch‚Äù (see above) could play a role in the pathogenesis of insomnia. According to the two-process model of sleep regulation (Borb√©ly, 1982), sleep-wake behaviour is governed by circadian time-keeping mechanisms and a homeostatically con- trolled process S, representing the sleep drive. Being out of synchrony with the internal body clock (e.g. due to shift work) or having a decreased sleep drive would logically result in sleep complaints. Indeed, the main effective component of CBT-I, sleep restriction, is hypothesized to act on the sleep drive (Maurer et al., 2018), and long- term effectiveness of CBT-I improves with the addition of circadian interventions (Dekker et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2021). Notwith- standing these effects, decades of research in insomnia have failed to reveal circadian and homeostatic mechanisms as primary factors involved the origin and pathophysiology of the majority of people suf- fering from ID (Van Someren, 2021). One might conclude that enhancement of homeostatic sleep pressure and support of circadian rhythm amplitude alleviates insomnia, but that we may have to look beyond hourglass and clock to find underlying causes predisposing to insomnia.  A third factor involved in sleep and predisposing to insomnia is emotion (Saper et al., 2005). This factor is frequently overlooked, in spite of the ubiquitous experience that sleep initiation is difficult under threatening conditions‚Äîno matter what our hourglass and clock suggest. Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective this would be extremely disadvantageous. An increasing number of observations suggests a key role of this third factor in the origin and pathophysiol- ogy of the predisposition to insomnia (for review, see Van Someren, 2021). For example, the trait to exhibit a pronounced dis- turbed sleep response to stressful events has been shown to be a major risk factor for insomnia (Drake et al., 2014).

(2021) used an event-related potentials paradigm to demonstrate that ID patients differed from good sleepers by showing reduced P2 amplitudes only in phasic REM sleep. These studies highlight a special role of REM sleep for insomnia.  The mechanisms underlying this special role of REM sleep in the predisposition, perpetuation and psychiatric consequences were addressed in a series of seminal studies (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019). In brief, Wassing et al. showed that the restless REM sleep that is characteristic of people with insomnia interferes with overnight adaptation in limbic circuits of the brain. The consequential difficulties with dissolving of distress could be key to the development and perpetuation of hyperarousal as well to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, as supported by other studies (Halonen et al., 2021; Pesonen et al., 2019). Restless sleep lacks the prolonged silencing of the locus coeruleus and consequential drop in cerebral noradrenaline that characterizes normal restful REM sleep (Kjearby et al., 2020). Because REM sleep is a period of pronounced limbic reactivation of emotional memory traces, it has been hypothe- sized that the increased level of noradrenaline during restless REM sleep interferes with the synaptic plasticity processes underlying adaptation of the neuronal engrams that represent distress, and could even result in sensitization, indicating maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021). Others have proposed that the low level of nor- adrenaline during REM sleep is key to restore the noradrenergic tone, to enable a low tonic and high phasic locus coeruleus activity during wakefulness (Goldstein & Walker, 2014).  Restless REM sleep thus has a specific contribution to ‚Äúemo- tional‚Äù perpetuating factors, and may explain why patients with insomnia are so prone to develop anxiety and depressive disorders in the long run. Indeed, sleep has been conceptualized as a basic psycho- physiological process that is fundamental for stress, behaviour and emotion regulation (Hagger, 2010; Palmer & Alfano, 2017). Consis- tently, most mental disorders are associated with sleep impairment (Baglioni et al., 2016), and insomnia-related problems in children have been linked with difficulties in socio-emotional development (Sadeh et al., 2014; Vermeulen et al., 2021). In adults, insomnia has been found to be a predictor of years-long lingering of emotional distress (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019), of depres- sion, and of anxiety disorders (Baglioni et al., 2011; Hertenstein et al., 2019; Leerssen et al., 2021). Experimental studies have shown that patients with insomnia report more negative emotions than good sleepers (McCrae et al., 2008; Scott & Judge, 2006). Psychophysiolog- ical studies have also evidenced an emotional bias in people with insomnia to sleep-related stimuli with negative valence compared with good sleepers (Baglioni et al., 2010; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014).  Perpetuating factors also include inadequate ‚Äúbehaviours‚Äù, like prolonged bedtimes, irregular sleep-wake schedules, napping during the day and other maladaptive behaviours, such as using alcohol to  combat insomnia. Usually, these strategies are attempted to  compensate for lost sleep; however, in the end insomnia is maintained and exacerbated by decreasing sleep drive.  In addition, ‚Äúcognitive perpetuating factors‚Äù have been identified, such as beliefs, worry and attentional bias (Espie, 2002; Harvey, 2002; Morin et al., 2007). These cognitions include unrealistic beliefs about sleep requirements and excessive worry for not meeting these stan- dards. In recent years, the literature has emphasized the role of selec- tive attention processes in people with insomnia. Specifically, it has been argued that the attentional system of patients with insomnia may be abnormally sensitive to sleep-related information (Harris et al., 2015). It has been hypothesized that such attention bias may exacerbate sleep-related rumination and lead to sleep effort (Espie et al., 2006; Harvey, 2002).  Summarizing, acute precipitating life events can ‚Äúset the wheels in motion‚Äô‚Äîacute insomnia is triggered. The question of why most individuals who develop acute insomnia do not go on to develop the chronic condition has not yet been clarified (Ellis et al., 2012)‚Äîbut likely involves genetic and early life stress-induced neurobiological vulnerability to keep ‚Äúthe train rolling.‚Äù A complex network of associ- ated symptoms including cognitive-, emotional- and cerebral hyper- arousal, unstable REM sleep and maladaptive behaviours will keep the furnace burning.

An overview of the present state of hypnotic treatment can be found in reviews (Herring et al., 2019; Riemann & Nissen, 2012; Roehrs & Roth, 2012).  The CBT-I comprises a family of interventions and is not ‚Äúone‚Äù homogenous therapeutic strategy per se (Table 2).  The CBT-I is in essence a multicomponent approach, comprising cognitive and behavioural parts, within each of which domain there is a wide range of treatment options. The principal behavioural therapies are sleep restriction and stimulus control. Cognitive techniques include reappraisal, cognitive control and paradoxical intention. There is also a range of relaxation therapies, and sleep hygiene education, although not effective as a standalone treatment, is commonly part of the CBT-I toolkit. A brief description of these techniques is given in the table. For further details, the interested reader is referred to a new CBT-I textbook that will be published in 2022 (Baglioni et al., 2022). A new clinician handbook on insomnia will also be avail- able shortly (Espie, 2022).  Logically therefore CBT-I is not ‚Äúa treatment‚Äù but is ‚Äúa system of cognitive and behavioural therapeutics‚Äù, akin to pharmacotherapy (which is not a drug treatment but a ‚Äúpharmaceutical approach‚Äù to clinical care; Espie, 2022). The history of evidence-based psychother- apy (in most disorders) reveals a period of time during which there was a tendency towards ‚Äúlumping‚Äù of therapeutic elements, rather than the creation of precision techniques that ‚Äúmay‚Äù be used in com- bination. This is certainly true of the non-pharmacological manage- ment of insomnia, and the term CBT-I has for the past 20 years or more been used rather generically in the literature because the major- ity of studies have deployed a CBT-I package.  In earlier times there was a focus upon more specific interven- tions. For example, comparing the effectiveness of abbreviated pro- gressive relaxation, stimulus control therapy and paradoxical intention (Espie et al., 1989), or even investigating components of a single ther- apy (Woolfolk & McNulty, 1983: compared progressive relaxation, progressive relaxation without tension release, imagery with tension release, and imagery without tension release). Interestingly, of late, there has been renewed interest in single-component therapies. We now find ourselves unpicking or deconstructing CBT to evaluate its active component treatments, and even its active treatment ingredi- ents. The best example is sleep restriction therapy (SRT), widely reg- arded to be the most effective element of CBT (Edinger et al., 2021a; Maurer, Schneider et al., 2021). A series of laboratory-based experi- ments has recently explored the homeostatic, arousal and circadian mechanisms of sleep restriction (Maurer et al., 2020, 2022; Maurer, Ftouni et al., 2021).  In support of this is the fact that CBT protocols are effective even when they vary. The AASM practice parameters task force recently grappled with the question, what are the ‚Äúminimal characteristics‚Äù of effective CBT (Edinger et al., 2021a). They concluded that ‚Äúall studies included SRT, stimulus control and some form of cognitive therapy‚Äù; however, the cognitive component varied widely. Whether or not  relaxation strategies or sleep hygiene were included in the CBT-I  regimen varied across studies as well. It was beyond the scope of this (group) to recommend a specific CBT protocol, and ‚Äúthese variations did not appear to systematically impact the effectiveness of the treat- ment‚Äù (p. 261). This evidences the versatility and robustness of what is sometimes now referred to as CBTx (cognitive and behavioural therapeutics), that is, a ‚Äútherapeutic formulary‚Äù, where not everyone needs the same content, or the same order of content (Espie, 2022). Analysis of how SRT is configured suggests there is gross variability between studies and protocols (Kyle et al., 2015); it would be prudent to establish what is the most effective combination of SRT parame- ters, including tailoring to presenting insomnia phenotype. Indeed, the widespread development of ‚Äúprecision medicine‚Äù (Ginsburg & Willard, 2009; Jain, 2002) has spawned interest in how ‚Äúpersonalized behavioural sleep medicine‚Äù for insomnia may evolve in the future (Kyle et al., 2014).  Despite the impressive evidence base for CBT-l, its recognition internationally as the treatment of first choice for the management of insomnia and the fact that the CBTx formulary of treatments is quite wide ranging, in practice the majority of insomnia patients seeking medical help continue to receive medication. The issue here is not so much overprescribing of drugs as it is under-provision of CBT-I. Two innovations have been developed to address this problem. The first, at the level of the treatment itself there has been growing interest in, and a rapidly accelerating evidence base for digital CBT-I, that is CBT-I delivered by fully automated web and mobile means. The sec- ond, at the level of the service, has been the development of the ‚Äústepped care‚Äù model of insomnia service delivery.  The effectiveness of digital CBT-I has been robustly and rigor- ously demonstrated against psychological placebo (Espie et al., 2012), attention control (Christensen et al., 2016; Kaldo et al., 2015), sleep hygiene (Espie et al., 2019; Ritterband et al., 2017; Vedaa et al., 2020), waitlist (Zachariae et al., 2018) and usual care (Freeman et al., 2017) in a range of clinical and co-morbid populations.

In this regard, pooling data from different sleep labs could be ben- eficial in order to address the issues of small sample sizes and poor replicability in the insomnia field. This would require the use of stan- dard methodology and paradigms across different labs. The UK Bio- bank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk; see Allen et al., 2014 for a detailed description), a large biomedical database including a sample of about 500,000 adults, has already proven to be useful for insomnia research (Uansen et al., 2019; Kyle et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2019). Although the UK Biobank is not specifically optimized for insomnia research, cross- validation showed the available phenotype to very accurately match diagnosed insomnia patients (Hammerschlag et al., 2017).  Given the costs and artificiality of the traditional sleep laboratory, home-based easy to apply measures need to be developed, allowing repetitive CNS-based measurements in the natural environments of our patients, reaching beyond actigraphy (Debener et al., 2015; Mikkelsen et al., 2019). This would allow to study the dynamics of fea- tures reflecting the sleep drive and REM sleep characteristics longitu- dinally and in relation to different treatments and their outcomes in much more detail.  Given the prominence of the hyperarousal concept in almost all insomnia models, one should also start to think about developing a hyperarousal test, which at best could be applied during daytime or rou- tine office/hospital hours. One could think about a stress/challenge par- adigm, measuring autonomous nervous system activity (e.g. heart rate, galvanic skin response, etc.), cortisol as main marker of the stress response and EEG during baseline, rest and different stress conditions. One of the best accepted stress paradigms now is the Trier social stress test‚Äîits usefulness has already been tested (Chen et al., 2017). Alterna- tively, probably just the instruction ‚Äúplease try to sleep now‚Äù probably might offset a marked stress response in insomniacs. Such a psycho- physiological paradigm administered during the day can also easily be coupled with neuroimaging methods, that is, functional magnetic reso- nance imaging. Needless to say, these data should be coupled with descriptive questionnaire data. Assuming that it will be possible to develop an easy to apply and valid hyperarousal test, this instrument could be used for phenotyping, relating the data to (epi-)genetic data, general diagnostics, differential-therapeutics and therapy outcomes. Given the emerging evidence of maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021), essential insights could require repeated assessment of hyperarousal from evening to morning across recorded nights. Analyses can then address which sleep features determine the overnight fate of distress‚Äîwhich could range from full adaptation even to maladaptive sensitization (Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al, 2019). Nevertheless, deeper insights into the mechanisms of hyperarousal in insomnia, its causes and consequences for cognitive processes and brain health in general are needed. This will help to fur- ther increase the value of the hyperarousal concept for insomnia research and could also help to identify a valid hyperarousal test.  Interestingly, also with therapeutics at present we have reached a  unique situation concerning treatment‚Äîall presently published  ai 11 of 18  relevant guidelines agree that CBT-I should be the first-line treatment     for insomnia. A statement like this would have caused a lot of many raised eyebrows even just 10 years ago! This development is probably because on one hand, the CBT-I literature is blooming and has gener- ated a solid and ever-increasing evidence base, but on the other hand maybe also due to a stagnation in the sector of hypnotic development and the withdrawal of many major players in psychopharmacology from CNS-oriented Research & Development. It has to be judged in the next few years whether the worldwide introduction of orexin receptor antagonists will markedly alter the hypnotic market. From a future perspective, we would like to suggest that research into the roles of histamine and noradrenaline and sleep regulation could lead to new discoveries (Thakkar, 2011; Van Someren, 2021). Maybe also approaches encompassing non-invasive brain stimulation might com- plement insomnia treatment strategies (Herrero Babiloni et al., 2021).  A better understanding of the psychoneurobiological mechanisms of insomnia is urgently needed to monitor and evaluate treatment effects of CBT-I beyond subjective measures, and further develop complementary treatment strategies. First, preliminary findings sug- gest that 1 night of experimental sleep restriction (delaying bedtime by 2 hr) may help to stabilize restless REM sleep (Kao et al., 2021). However, it remains to be seen whether this stabilization is observed in therapeutic SRT, and whether it translates into improvements in regulation of emotional distress, hyperarousal and the risk of develop- ing mental disorders. Second, notwithstanding the established efficacy of CBT-lI, it is important to acknowledge that two out of five patients do not show full remission, even after boosting CBT-I effects with subsequent pharmacological treatment (Morin et al., 2020). We still have very limited insight into who will respond and who will not. Novel graph theory-based analyses like network outcome analysis and network intervention analysis may reveal how non-responders differ in their initial symptom profiles and trajectories of change of symp- toms during the intervention (Blanken, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Blanken et al., 2020; Blanken, van der Zweerde, et al., 2019). Pinpointing such differences could provide leads to novel strategies.  Also the gradual wearing off of initial benefits of CBT-I deserves attention (van der Zweerde et al., 2019).

      "RIEMANN er at.     wofis| PERE. , RE SP ily  based on CBT-I as a basic mode in psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment.  One step further will address the primary prevention of mental disorders. There is a strong probability that adequate insomnia treat- ment will reduce the incidence and recurrence of depressive episodes and anxiety disorders (Benz et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2019; Irwin et al., 2022; Leerssen et al., 2021). In a first step, one might address risk groups especially prone to mental illness and offer sleep treat- ment versus a control condition and compare longitudinal outcomes, as recently demonstrated by Leerssen et al. (2021). In a next step it might be tested whether educating and training of the general popula- tion to utilize the principles that underlie CBT-I could prevent insom- nia. Such efforts may be especially relevant to prevent mental disorders that tend to surface during important transition periods, like  in students moving from high school to university.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST  Dieter Riemann is a member of the Executive Board of FAVT (Freiburg Institute for Behavioural Therapy/non for profit), a salaried activity. He is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Sleep Research, which is owned by the European Sleep Research Society (non-profit body) and receives payments for this task. Dieter Riemann receives royalties from publish- ing and honoraria for lecturing (no pharmaceutical industry), and is funded by several grants from the German Federal state. Colin A.

Among the others, the evolution of the debate about dreaming in the cognitivist frame- work (Rosner et al., 2004) represents an interesting example of the redefinition of dreamwork in psychotherapy based on novel experi- mental data, theoretical models, and clinical observations. Beck (1971) proposed that dreams reflect the individual conception (and biases) about the self, the world, and the future, and may represent and indi- cator of changes in the emotional status. Nevertheless, the initial need to move away from the psychoanalytical framework and the pressure to adopt an empirically verifiable clinical model led to a common dis- use of oneiric activity in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy.'}, {'documents': 'Temporal sequence and unit composi- tion in dream reports from different stages of sleep.', 'doc_name': 'What about dreams  State of the art and open questions', 'page_num': 8, 'sentence_num': 11, 'distances': 0.9127646088600159, 'surrounding_sentences': 'Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65, 14-25. https://doi.org/10.1037/ h0040431  Foulkes, D.

Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself. In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake. Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult. From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports. While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008). These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).'}, {'documents': 'Here, we summarise  Correspondence the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dreaming.', 'doc_name': 'What about dreams  State of the art and open questions', 'page_num': 0, 'sentence_num': 1, 'distances': 0.9510078430175781, 'surrounding_sentences': 'State of the art and open questions  Serena Scarpellit¬Æ | Valentina Alfonsit¬Æ | Maurizio Gorgoni? ?¬Æ | Luigi De Gennaro*? ¬©  1Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy Summary Body and Action Lab, IRCCS Fondazione Several studies have tried to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experiences,  Santa Lucia, Rome, Ital : 5 ¬¢ ane HSI SOME ANY, nevertheless some questions are still at the centre of the debate.

Several studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experi- ence through a neuropsychological approach (Solms, 1997, 2000), neuroimaging (Maquet et al., 1996) and electrophysiological tech- niques (Marzano et al., 2011; Siclari et al., 2017). Although several studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of specific brain mechanisms predicting dream recall (e.g., Siclari et al., 2017), many questions are still at the centre of the debate. The present paper summarises the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dream experience. Specifically, the review offers an overview about (a) the question related to the REM-non- REM (NREM) sleep dichotomy, (b) the state-trait-like problem, (c) the relationship between waking and dreaming state and the manipulation of dreaming, (d) the issue concerning the access to dream experience, (e) the role of nightmares, and (f) the debate on dreamwork in  psychotherapy. 1.1. | The REM-NREM sleep dichotomy  Acclassical view of the neurobiological basis of the oneiric activity pos- tulates the existence of a close relationship between dream experi- ence and REM sleep (Hobson et al., 2000; Nielsen, 2000).'}, {'documents': 'Dreaming, 6(1), 1-16.', 'doc_name': 'What about dreams  State of the art and open questions', 'page_num': 8, 'sentence_num': 91, 'distances': 0.9604711532592773, 'surrounding_sentences': 'Sleep Medicine Reviews, 42, 10-18. https://doi. org/10.1016/j.smrv.2018.04.002  Leslie, K., & Ogilvie, R.

According to this view, REM sleep is characterised by an emotional, vivid, and bizarre ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù mentation (Antrobus, 1983; Casagrande et al., 1996; Foulkes, 1967; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983; Waterman et al., 1993), while NREM mental activity would be ‚Äúthought-like‚Äù, with reduced emotional load, greater fragmentation, and contents more similar to waking thoughts (Foulkes, 1967; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963).

It is worth not- ing that a precise definition of the time-coupling between the sleep stages and the actual occurrence of dream experience is difficult, as the access to sleep mentation is possible only in an indirect way through dream reports after the awakening (see the paragraph ‚ÄúWhat about direct access to dream experience?‚Äù). At the same time, the occurrence of dream experiences in both REM and NREM sleep, two physiological stages characterised by distinct electrophysiological and neurotransmitters patterns, appears paradoxical.

      "13. The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address. Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself. In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake. Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult. From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports. While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008). These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).\n",

      "The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address. Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself. In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake. Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult. From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports. While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008). These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).\n",

      "The enthusiasm linked to the discovery of REM sleep considerably influenced dreaming research in several ways, and the neuroscientific study of dreaming is relatively recent. Several studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experi- ence through a neuropsychological approach (Solms, 1997, 2000), neuroimaging (Maquet et al., 1996) and electrophysiological tech- niques (Marzano et al., 2011; Siclari et al., 2017). Although several studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of specific brain mechanisms predicting dream recall (e.g., Siclari et al., 2017), many questions are still at the centre of the debate. The present paper summarises the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dream experience. Specifically, the review offers an overview about (a) the question related to the REM-non- REM (NREM) sleep dichotomy, (b) the state-trait-like problem, (c) the relationship between waking and dreaming state and the manipulation of dreaming, (d) the issue concerning the access to dream experience, (e) the role of nightmares, and (f) the debate on dreamwork in  psychotherapy. 1.1. | The REM-NREM sleep dichotomy  Acclassical view of the neurobiological basis of the oneiric activity pos- tulates the existence of a close relationship between dream experi- ence and REM sleep (Hobson et al., 2000; Nielsen, 2000).\n",

      "Indeed, it has been pro- posed that REM and NREM sleep exhibit different kinds of mental activity. According to this view, REM sleep is characterised by an emotional, vivid, and bizarre ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù mentation (Antrobus, 1983; Casagrande et al., 1996; Foulkes, 1967; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983; Waterman et al., 1993), while NREM mental activity would be ‚Äúthought-like‚Äù, with reduced emotional load, greater fragmentation, and contents more similar to waking thoughts (Foulkes, 1967; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963). Nevertheless, the existence of a clear-cut REM-NREM dichotomy has been questioned also in this case based on several findings: (a) ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù reports have been observed also after NREM sleep (Monroe et al., 1965; Solms, 2000; Zimmerman, 1970) and (b) the qualitative differences between REM and NREM dream reports disappear when their length is equated (Antrobus, 1983; Cavallero et al., 1992; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983). In light of these observations, the assumption that the presence/ absence and the phenomenological aspects of dream experiences strictly depend on the sleep stage per se is simplistic. It is worth not- ing that a precise definition of the time-coupling between the sleep stages and the actual occurrence of dream experience is difficult, as the access to sleep mentation is possible only in an indirect way through dream reports after the awakening (see the paragraph ‚ÄúWhat about direct access to dream experience?‚Äù). At the same time, the occurrence of dream experiences in both REM and NREM sleep, two physiological stages characterised by distinct electrophysiological and neurotransmitters patterns, appears paradoxical. Such considerations raised the question of what mechanisms facilitate/inhibit the recall of a conscious experience at the awakening from different sleep stages, and what factors can explain intra- and inter-individual variability in  the phenomenology of the oneiric activity.\n",

According to different approaches, the role of dream has been conceptualised in terms of reorganisation of the experience (Fosshage, 2002), adaptation to reality (Gazzillo et al., 2020), and co- construction of the intersubjective reality Jim√©nez, 2012). Although several authors underline a ‚Äúmarginalisation‚Äù of dream in modern clinical psychological practice (Leonard & Dawson, 2018), it is worth noting that dreams have become an object of study also in clinical paradigms different from the psychoanalytical models (Pesant & Zadra, 2004; Velotti & Zavattini, 2019). Among the others, the evolution of the debate about dreaming in the cognitivist frame- work (Rosner et al., 2004) represents an interesting example of the redefinition of dreamwork in psychotherapy based on novel experi- mental data, theoretical models, and clinical observations. Beck (1971) proposed that dreams reflect the individual conception (and biases) about the self, the world, and the future, and may represent and indi- cator of changes in the emotional status. Nevertheless, the initial need to move away from the psychoanalytical framework and the pressure to adopt an empirically verifiable clinical model led to a common dis- use of oneiric activity in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy.\n",

      "The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address. Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is ‚Äúdream recall‚Äô and not the dream experience itself. In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake. Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult. From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports. While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008). These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019).\n",

      "The enthusiasm linked to the discovery of REM sleep considerably influenced dreaming research in several ways, and the neuroscientific study of dreaming is relatively recent. Several studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experi- ence through a neuropsychological approach (Solms, 1997, 2000), neuroimaging (Maquet et al., 1996) and electrophysiological tech- niques (Marzano et al., 2011; Siclari et al., 2017). Although several studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of specific brain mechanisms predicting dream recall (e.g., Siclari et al., 2017), many questions are still at the centre of the debate. The present paper summarises the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dream experience. Specifically, the review offers an overview about (a) the question related to the REM-non- REM (NREM) sleep dichotomy, (b) the state-trait-like problem, (c) the relationship between waking and dreaming state and the manipulation of dreaming, (d) the issue concerning the access to dream experience, (e) the role of nightmares, and (f) the debate on dreamwork in  psychotherapy. 1.1. | The REM-NREM sleep dichotomy  Acclassical view of the neurobiological basis of the oneiric activity pos- tulates the existence of a close relationship between dream experi- ence and REM sleep (Hobson et al., 2000; Nielsen, 2000).\n",

      "Indeed, it has been pro- posed that REM and NREM sleep exhibit different kinds of mental activity. According to this view, REM sleep is characterised by an emotional, vivid, and bizarre ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù mentation (Antrobus, 1983; Casagrande et al., 1996; Foulkes, 1967; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983; Waterman et al., 1993), while NREM mental activity would be ‚Äúthought-like‚Äù, with reduced emotional load, greater fragmentation, and contents more similar to waking thoughts (Foulkes, 1967; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963). Nevertheless, the existence of a clear-cut REM-NREM dichotomy has been questioned also in this case based on several findings: (a) ‚Äúdream-like‚Äù reports have been observed also after NREM sleep (Monroe et al., 1965; Solms, 2000; Zimmerman, 1970) and (b) the qualitative differences between REM and NREM dream reports disappear when their length is equated (Antrobus, 1983; Cavallero et al., 1992; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983). In light of these observations, the assumption that the presence/ absence and the phenomenological aspects of dream experiences strictly depend on the sleep stage per se is simplistic. It is worth not- ing that a precise definition of the time-coupling between the sleep stages and the actual occurrence of dream experience is difficult, as the access to sleep mentation is possible only in an indirect way through dream reports after the awakening (see the paragraph ‚ÄúWhat about direct access to dream experience?‚Äù). At the same time, the occurrence of dream experiences in both REM and NREM sleep, two physiological stages characterised by distinct electrophysiological and neurotransmitters patterns, appears paradoxical. Such considerations raised the question of what mechanisms facilitate/inhibit the recall of a conscious experience at the awakening from different sleep stages, and what factors can explain intra- and inter-individual variability in  the phenomenology of the oneiric activity.\n",

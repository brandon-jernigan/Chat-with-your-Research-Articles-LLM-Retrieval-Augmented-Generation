Statistics of Dreams,2,1,STATISTICS OF DREAMS.
Statistics of Dreams,2,2,By Mary WuHiron CALKIns.'
Statistics of Dreams,2,3,"Instructor in Psychology, Wellesley College."
Statistics of Dreams,2,4,"The phenomenon of dreaming has rarely been discussed or investigated in a thorough and in an experimental manner; of description, of theory, of discussion, of poetical analogy and illustration there has been no end; of accurate observa- tion almost nothing.2 The most scientific books—those of Maury and of Tissié—have been wholly or chiefly the result of the observation of abnormal subjects, and in the interest, more or less distinctly, of pathology."
Statistics of Dreams,2,5,The fullest discussion ‘of the subject—the works of Radestock and of Spitta—are largely compilations of the recorded dreams of other people.
Statistics of Dreams,2,6,"The basis of the following paper is the accurate record of the dreams of two people, from notes made by themselves during the night, and supplemented by careful study and recollection on the following day."
Statistics of Dreams,2,7,The investigation was un- -dertaken at the suggestion of Dr. Sanford and was carried on for six or eight weeks.
Statistics of Dreams,2,8,"Its method was very simple: to re- cord each night, immediately after waking from a dream, ‘every remembered feature of it."
Statistics of Dreams,2,9,"For this purpose, paper, pencil, candle and matches were placed close at hand."
Statistics of Dreams,2,10,"Early ‘on the next day, with rare exceptions, these abbreviated notes were re-read, copied in full and enlarged by comments, by ‘description of all attendant circumstances, and by the indica- tion in all possible cases of the connection of the dream with the waking life."
Statistics of Dreams,2,11,"During the first weeks of the experiments, an alarm clock was used to wake the experimenter at differ- ent hours of the night."
Statistics of Dreams,2,12,"Later, the use of the clock was dis- ‘continued because the excitement of waking through its agency was often so great as to prevent connected memory of the dream."

Statistics of Dreams,3,1,312 MINOR STUDIES.
Statistics of Dreams,3,2,"Omitting, so far as possible, all general discussion of the na-~ ture and the explanation—physiological and psychological— of dreaming, I shall chiefly discuss the classified results of the observations to which allusion has been made."
Statistics of Dreams,3,3,"It will be well, therefore, to give at once the general results of the statistics and to indicate some of the difficulties."
Statistics of Dreams,3,4,Chief among these is that of recalling dreams after one has waked.
Statistics of Dreams,3,5,"Doubtless this is due, both to the lack of congruity between the waking and the dreaming life, and to the slight excite- ment which often accompanies the act of waking."
Statistics of Dreams,3,6,To recall a dream requires usually extreme and immediate attention to the content of the dream.
Statistics of Dreams,3,7,"Sometimes the slight movement of reaching for paper and pencil or of lighting one’s candle seems to dissipate the dream-memory, and one is left with the tantalizing consciousness of having lived through an interest- ing dream-experience of which one has not the faintest memory."
Statistics of Dreams,3,8,"To delay until morning the record of a dream, so vivid that one feels sure of remembering it, is usually a fatal errer."
Statistics of Dreams,3,9,"During the progress of the observations, the account of one dream, apparently of peculiar significance, was written out in the dark by the experimenter, who then sank off to  eep with the peaceful consciousness of a scientific duty well done."
Statistics of Dreams,3,10,"In the morning the discovery was made that an un- sharpened pencil had been used, and the experimenter was left with a blank sheet of paper and no remotest memory of the dream, so carefully recalled after dreaming it."
Statistics of Dreams,3,11,"The difficulty in remembering dreams suggests, of course, the impossibility of an exhaustive enumeration of their peculiarities and of any positive conclusions from the figures of such tabular views as will be offered."
Statistics of Dreams,3,12,"At the best, one may discuss only dreams as remembered, and the power of recol- lection varies widely with age, temperament, health and other conditions."
Statistics of Dreams,3,13,"A dream which is remembered in detail must have been a vivid one, but it is not true, as we often assume, that a vivid dream is necessarily well remembered, for both dream-records here considered contain several cases of ‘‘vivid dreams immediately forgotten.’’ In one case a distinct memory of a vivid visual dream of a newspaper in- cluded no faintest recollection of one word on the page."
Statistics of Dreams,3,14,"It seems certain, therefore, that most people dream much oftener than they think."
Statistics of Dreams,3,15,"While some dreams thus escape the memory, the very effort to record may well tend in the contrary direction, toward an increase of their number."
Statistics of Dreams,3,16,The observer with the recording ‘‘on his mind’?
Statistics of Dreams,3,17,"may sleep less soundly, dream more and wake oftener."

Statistics of Dreams,4,2,"313  in danger of reading into his dream much that is charac- teristic of the waking consciousness, something as one interprets an animal’s actions by one’s own."
Statistics of Dreams,4,3,"As the dog is said to ‘‘reason’’ when he performs—instinctively, for aught we know—an act which would imply reasoning on our part, so emotions, thought and deliberation, which were real- ly absent from a train of dream-images, may be supplied by the reflective after-consciousness."
Statistics of Dreams,4,4,With these preliminary cautions one may turn to the study of the figures.
Statistics of Dreams,4,5,"The observers will be designated as 8. and C. S., a man of thirty-two, took notes for 46 nights and recorded 170 dreams ; C., the writer, a woman of twenty-eight, took notes on 55 nights and recorded 205 dreams, an average of nearly four dreams a night in each case."
Statistics of Dreams,4,6,Neither observer had previously regarded himself as a frequent dreamer.
Statistics of Dreams,4,7,"After the records were completed, each worked up the figures for his own dreams, with occasional conferences with the other."
Statistics of Dreams,4,8,"Such individual treatment was unavoidable where the rela- tions of the content of the dreams to previous experience were to be considered; some differences were thus introduced into parallel tables, but none of them are regarded as of great importance."

Statistics of Dreams,6,6,"It is impossible to conclude that the dreams which follow most immediately upon our daytime experience will be more closely united with it than the morning dreams ; and equally wrong to conclude that dreams during the lighter sleep of morning, nearer the waking-state, will be more congruous with the waking-life."

Statistics of Dreams,6,17,"are of the same general import as those of Table ITI., though the proportion of dreams suggested by waking-life is much smaller."
Statistics of Dreams,6,18,This is undoubtedly due in part to a different criterion in classifying.
Statistics of Dreams,6,19,"The dreams of S. were very frequently pervaded with an atmosphere of experi- ment, not definite enough to warrant placing them in the class of vague suggestion, but undoubtedly dictated by the waking occupation, though possibly also by the very attempt to record the dreams."
Statistics of Dreams,6,20,"Furthermore, dreams in which the companions of waking-life were present were not included as suggested dreams unless some incident of the dream was also suggested."
Statistics of Dreams,6,21,The next tables embody an attempt to classify the dreams according to their vividness.

Statistics of Dreams,7,3,"Because a dream is indistinctly remembered, it is not fair to conclude that it is not a vivid one, yet it is not safe to trust altogether to a mere memory of vividness without any sup- port for the impression."
Statistics of Dreams,7,4,"The degree to which a dream is re- called (which may be roughly gauged by the length of the written record) is thus a convenient, though not an absolute, test of the vividness of a dream.!"

Statistics of Dreams,11,3,"Visual presentation dreams are less frequent, but dreams from dermal excitation occur comparatively often, and the occasioning sensation is apt to be much exaggerated."
Statistics of Dreams,11,4,"For instance, a dream of struggling to crawl from an elevator, through an absurdly small opening, into an eighth-floor apart- ment, was traced directly to a cramped position and to a heavy covering across the face; a dream of a sleigh-ride on an in- tensely cold day, and of hearing that the cornea of a friend’s eyes had broken from the cold, was evidently occasioned by a stiff breeze blowing in at the window."

Statistics of Dreams,11,11,Our rec- ords contain no instances of dreams initiated by actual movement.

Statistics of Dreams,22,9,"This tallies exactly with the result of the dream census of persons, by which the associates of our dreams are seen to be in large number the companions of the every day life of the immediate present ; and the result falls in also with the surprising conclusion from the attempt to classify dreams according to the time in which, as one dreams, one supposes oneself to be living."
Statistics of Dreams,22,10,"In all the 375 cases which our records include, there is no instance of a dream in any other than the present time."
Statistics of Dreams,22,11,"When the dream was of the childhood’s home, or of some person who had not been seen for many years, the apparent age of the dreamer was never lessened to avoid anachronism."
Statistics of Dreams,22,12,"Whatever the place or character, the subject was always at his proper age and in his general condition of life (excepting, of course, in the few cases of changed identity)."
Statistics of Dreams,22,13,"It is thus evident that the dream is connected with the waking life, and—in the experience of these observers— usually with the recent life."
Statistics of Dreams,22,14,"But what besides recency deter- mines the exact line of association, the particular elements which, in a sense,” are reproduced in the dream?"
Statistics of Dreams,22,15,"If we were discussing waking association, we should name two other fac- tors, vividness and frequency, and should especially emphasize the fact that the subjects of conscious thought or imagination are those in which we are most deeply interested."
Statistics of Dreams,22,16,"The first impression is that the same holds true of dreams, and that the subjects of dreams are those in which our waking interest is centered."

Statistics of Dreams,23,14,Such are mostly dreams about one’s own home.
Statistics of Dreams,23,15,"The trivial or accidental dream or dream- element is one so unimportant that it might equally well be dreamed with reference to another person or situation.”  The figures, however little one emphasizes their rigid accu- racy, certainly indicate, what any one may verify by exami- nation of his own dreams, the constancy of the trivial and the accidental, the tendency of the unimportant events of the waking life to reappear in our dreams, and the surprising few- ness of the cases in which the dream is associated with that which is of paramount significance in one’s waking expe- rience."
Statistics of Dreams,23,16,"The so-called ‘‘personal’’ dreams seldom, if ever, re- fer to really important phases of personal relation."

Statistics of Dreams,24,3,"The fact is often denied, chiefly because of the overwhelming impression pro- duced by the infrequent dreams of this nature, yet it is proved by the experience of all whom I have questioned, by the examination of the dream records, and by the careful in- quiries of M. Ives Délage,* the only writer, so far as I know, who has faced this problem."
Statistics of Dreams,24,4,"Monsieur Délage was pro- foundly impressed by the fact that during a long time of deep, personal sorrow, he never once dreamed of the friend whom he had lost, though he tried to provoke such dreams."
Statistics of Dreams,24,5,"There were at least two occasions during the months of investigation when, after days of very vivid memories, one of the observers confidently expected to dream of a friend who had died, yet actually dreamed only of the most trivialevents."
Statistics of Dreams,24,6,Both 8. and C. during the whole time dreamed of the dead very seldom and in unimportant connection with other persons.
Statistics of Dreams,24,7,"The scrutiny of these dream-records, in fact, bears out M. Délage’s conclu- sion: ‘(En régle generale, les idées qui ont obsédéV esprit pend- ant la veille ne reviennent pas en réve; on ne réve des événe- ments importants, que lorsque Vépoque 0% ils préoccupait Vesprit aun haut degré s'est eloignée.”’  M. Délage’s examination of the facts is very satisfactory, but his theory cannot be accepted."
Statistics of Dreams,24,8,"Every image or thought, he says, has a definite amount of energy."
Statistics of Dreams,24,9,"If this force be dissipated by directing to the image or idea the waking at- tention and interest, then none is left by which it may be lifted above the threshold of the dream consciousness; but if, as in the case of a trivial event, the attention has been di- verted from it and never rested on it exclusively, then when most presentations are barred out by sleep, when the ordi- nary activities of thought, judgment and attention are wholly wanting, or at least lethargic, then the trivial image or thought will rise into consciousness, and be transmitted through the dream alchemy into the rich and varied material of the dream."
Statistics of Dreams,24,10,"Passing by the untenable Herbartian assumption that ‘‘ ideas ’’ possess an independent existence of their own, one notices at once that this theory fails to account for all the facts."
Statistics of Dreams,24,11,Itis not true that one never dreams of subjects of vital interest to oneself.

Statistics of Dreams,25,3,"On the other hand, the persons of the dead and of the long absent, as well as the intimate thoughts, hopes and ideals of the inner life, involve the waking imagi- nation, thought, emotion and will, but not the sense percep- tion."
Statistics of Dreams,25,4,"The connection of the dream with the waking life, so far as it can be traced, is therefore simply this: the dream will reproduce, in general, the persons, places and events of re- cent sense perception or of very vivid imagination—not the ob- jects of ordinary imagination, of thought, of emotion or of will, so far as these are not also perceived objects."
Statistics of Dreams,25,5,"Furthermore, thoughts, emotions, experiences and personal relations that mean most to us are generally extremely complex, and depend for their reproduction on the integrity of very many lines of association."
Statistics of Dreams,25,6,"When a number of these are put temporarily out of function by sleep, it is next to impossible to bring about these complicated mental states, though less complica- ted ones can be reproduced with tolerable completeness."

Statistics of Dreams,25,8,"Up to this point the results of this classification of actual dreams have emphasized throughout the intimate connection of the dream with the waking life, and the essentially normal character of dream-activity."
Statistics of Dreams,25,9,Yet the characteristics which distinguish the dream from the rest of the psychic life are no less prominent.
Statistics of Dreams,25,10,"Fundamentally these are three : the compara- tive feebleness of the attention and the will, the want of dis- crimination, and the relative lack of perception."
Statistics of Dreams,25,11,"Herakleitos says that each man has his own world in sleep, but a world in common with others when awake, and Fichte describes the ob- jective world as created by the Absolute Ego, while the dream world is the creation of theindividualI."
Statistics of Dreams,25,12,"Both sayings point to the essential feature in which dreams diverge from the rest of the psychical experience, the appearance of objective reality which prevents the recognition of their subjective character."
Statistics of Dreams,25,13,"Of this phenomenon, these three explanations have been suggested: most of the sense-impressions are lacking which furnish to the waking consciousness the common test of reality; the weakness of the thought activity facilitates that wrong application of the category of causality, implicit in the false reference of a phenomenon of imagination to an ex- ternal cause and in the incorrect explanation of a sense ex- perience; the diminution of attention prevents a scrutiny of images and ideas sufficient to the discovery of their sub- jectivity."

Statistics of Dreams,26,1,STATISTICS OF DREAMS.
Statistics of Dreams,26,2,335  There are three stages in the dream illusion.
Statistics of Dreams,26,3,"The first is that simple objectivation which we have already described, and which is characteristic of all dreams."
Statistics of Dreams,26,4,"In the next higher stage, one attributes one’s own thoughts and feelings to other individuals, sometimes explicitly recognizing one’s own ignor- ance."
Statistics of Dreams,26,5,Of this nature is the dream which Johnson naively describes; he was conversing with a man who said more witty things than he.
Statistics of Dreams,26,6,"Another time-honored example is that of Van Goens, who dreamed of himself in a recitation, in which after a most painful effort, he failed, only to hear his neighbor correctly answering the same question."
Statistics of Dreams,26,7,Maury dreamed!
Statistics of Dreams,26,8,"of a person who told him the location of the place Mussidan, and of another who corrected his English sentence, ‘‘I called for you,” by suggesting the idiomatic ‘‘I called on you.’’ Both these bits of information Maury, in his waking mo- ments, did not consciously possess."
Statistics of Dreams,26,9,"These dreams in which the dreamer figures as the ignorant hearer of what he himself does not appear to know, are the most striking examples of this dream dramatization, but every conversation dream illustrates the same illusion."
Statistics of Dreams,26,10,"?_ Be- sides the general occasions of all objectivation, one observes here a failure of definite recollection."
Statistics of Dreams,26,11,"A vivid speech image of one’s own thought is followed by the vivid image of some person, and the two are associated through lack of definite memory of the connection of the thought with oneself.°  Finally, the loss of the personal identity may become ex- plicit."
Statistics of Dreams,26,12,"One imagines oneself to be another, or one is the double of oneself, and then there is a second self whom one sees or hears."
Statistics of Dreams,26,13,The special feature of these dreams is some- times characterized as a loss of self-consciousness.
Statistics of Dreams,26,14,"Spitta considers that the important differentiation of dream from waking is ‘‘die wihrend des Schlafens eintretende Aufhebung des Selbstbewusstseins,’’* but he makes the Herbartian dis- tinction between Bewusstsein and Selbstbewusstsein, and declares that ‘‘im Traume ist nur das Bewusstsein vorhan- den, das Selbstbewusstsein nicht.’ The fact is that ex- plicit self-consciousness is almost always present in dreams, and that the individual ego is exceptionally prominent in the dream life."
Statistics of Dreams,26,15,"The loss of identity in dreams is not a loss, but a change or doubling of self-consciousness."
Statistics of Dreams,26,16,"It is probably correct to explain it by failure to recall the events of one’s past history, or to localize them as referring to oneself."

Statistics of Dreams,28,17,"The incoherence of dreams proceeds from two main causes, one of which we have already discussed, the swift change of dream images through a process of modulated association."
Statistics of Dreams,28,18,"In this respect, the dream resembles revery, in which also the will and the judgment are in abeyance, and the subject half unconsciously makes Ideensprunge from one slender perch of thought to another."
Statistics of Dreams,28,19,"The second cause of incoherent dreams is effective also in revery; this is the intrusion of presenta- tions into the chain of images and thoughts, and is a common feature also of dreams and of madness."
Statistics of Dreams,28,20,"As in the case of dreams, such presentations sometimes abruptly change the course of consciousness and sometimes are woven into its strands."

Statistics of Dreams,30,5,"In the elephant dream just quoted, the judgment asserted itself in the surprise with which “at first’ the talking of the elephant was heard, but the wonder was soon quieted by the vividness of the impres- sion; it is interesting to observe that reflective thought was still present in the dream, since the peculiarity of the elephant was at once explained in true natural-history style."
Statistics of Dreams,30,6,"This possibility of dream thought, active enough to explain dream- images, but not keen enough to deny their externality, has appeared, already in the skull dream,” in which wonder at the insouctance with which the remarkable piece of surgery is performed, and at the deductions drawn from it, is accom- panied by the complete acceptance of the fact and by much reasonable reflection on it."

Statistics of Dreams,32,5,"The importance of the dream as @ revealer of character is not a suggestive topic,+ when one has discovered that both will and judgment are relaxed or al- together lacking, and that the very subjects of one’s dreams are unconnected with one’s deepest interests."
Statistics of Dreams,32,6,"The nature of prevision in dreams and the explanation of so-called ‘ pro- phetic’’ dreams, have received a certain modern interest from the labors of Myers, Gurney and others.?"
Statistics of Dreams,32,7,‘The first remark to be made is that the number and the significance of these have inevitably been exaggerated.
Statistics of Dreams,32,8,"Such dreams are seléom accurately recorded, and the after experience (the so-called fulfillment) supplies details which one then believes that one has dreamed, even when the illusion does not rise to com- plete paramnesia."
Statistics of Dreams,32,9,In the second place it may safely be asserted that a large number of these dreams admits of a perfectly natural explanation.
Statistics of Dreams,32,10,"Previsions of illness were long ago assigned by Hippokrates to real organic sensations, with which are as- sociated images of illness."
Statistics of Dreams,32,11,"A prevailing emotion persisting in sleep is associated with the image of some event as its oc- casion, and in the course of time this actually does occur."

Sleep Disorders,1,19,"The precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying insomnia have not been identified yet, but some neurobio- logical and psychological models have been proposed."
Sleep Disorders,1,20,"Con- tributing factors include behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and genetic factors.” These are often conceptually classified into predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors.°  Available treatments for insomnia include pharmacolog- ical and nonpharmacological therapies."
Sleep Disorders,1,21,"Treatment should consider other comorbidities that lead to sleep disruption, including other primary sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea and periodic limb movement in sleep)."
Sleep Disorders,1,22,"Initial counseling and education about good sleep practices is usually helpful, and often sufficient to reduce insomnia symptoms."
Sleep Disorders,1,23,"Good sleep habits include: keeping regular wake times (and explaining that duration of wakefulness and circadian rhythms both affect sleep onset); limiting time in bed to sleep time; use of bed for sleep/intimacy only; avoid afternoon caffeine and limit alcohol intake; and avoiding daytime napping (otherwise these should be very brief, <30 minutes, and taken in the early afternoon at latest)."
Sleep Disorders,1,24,"In cases of persistent insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy may prove very helpful."
Sleep Disorders,1,25,"Studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia may have equal or better effect than pharmacological treatment, and that the effect is longer lasting.’~'' Other behavioral treatment methods include sleep restriction and relaxation-based interventions."
Sleep Disorders,2,1,"K. Pavlova and Latreille Sleep Disorders  293     Pharmacological therapy may be appropriate when treat- ment is anticipated to be short (eg, insomnia in the setting of stress), or in addition to behavioral treatments."
Sleep Disorders,2,2,The choice of agent should consider: 1) predominant type of complaints —sleep initiation or sleep maintenance; 2) frequency of insomnia symptoms (nightly vs intermittent); 3) length of treatment anticipated; 4) age and comorbidities of the patient.

Sleep Disorders,2,14,"A history of sleepwalking as a child should be considered a caution when using zolpidem, as it may cause complex behaviors in sleep."
Sleep Disorders,2,15,'*~'* Other factors such as the patient’s age and sex should also be considered before starting pharmacological treatment for insomnia.
Sleep Disorders,2,16,"In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning, recommending that a lower dose of hypnotics be used to prevent next-morning impairment due to residual effect."
Sleep Disorders,2,17,"Women appear to be more susceptible to this risk (by FDA site, see Appendix, available online)."
Sleep Disorders,2,18,"Overall, medications most frequently used in the treat- ment of insomnia include: 1) Benzodiazepines: they have the advantages of being cheap and ubiquitous, however, they are associated with various problems: excessive seda- tion, high frequency of falls (due to nonselective gamma- aminobutyric acid effects), hypotension, tendency to lose efficacy after longer use, muscle relaxant effect, and signifi- cant cognitive effects."
Sleep Disorders,2,19,"2) Other hypnotics include: zolpi- dem, zolpidem CR, Intermezzo (Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT; zolpidem ultrashort acting, 1.75-3 mg), zaleplon, and eszopiclone."
Sleep Disorders,2,20,"The advantages of these hypnotics are that some are very short acting (Intermezzo, zaleplon), and are FDA-approved for chronic insomnia treatment (eszopi- clone, zolpidem CR)."
Sleep Disorders,2,21,"However, frequent problems include common side effects such as parasomnia, and over-seda- tion, and some also have a potential to lose efficacy."
Sleep Disorders,2,22,"3) Other options for insomnia treatment include: melatonin agonists (ramelteon, tasimelteon), orexin antagonist (suvor- exant), antidepressants (mirtazapine, trazodone, amitripty- line), antihistamines, and other substances (eg, herbal)."

Sleep Disorders,2,24,"Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders The timing of sleep and wakefulness is maintained on one end by homeostatic factors, and on another by the  and young adults, occurring in 7%- 16%."
Sleep Disorders,2,25,* Advanced sleep—wake phase disorder is estimated to occur in 1% of middle-aged adults and even more commonly in older populations.
Sleep Disorders,2,26,"Non-24-hour circadian rhythm disorder is thought to occur in > 50% of blind indi- viduals, and up to 80% of this population complains of sleep disturbances."
Sleep Disorders,2,27,Twenty percent of the workforce engages in shift work and 10%-38% of this population is estimated to suffer from shift work circadian rhythm disorder.
Sleep Disorders,2,28,*  The diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep —wake disorders are sometimes difficult without an accu- rate assessment of the patient’s circadian phase.
Sleep Disorders,2,29,"In research conditions, plasma measurements of melatonin, and core body temperature, are commonly used."
Sleep Disorders,2,30,"'° However, these are labor-intensive, expensive, require special settings, and are, therefore, impracticable for routine clinic use."
Sleep Disorders,2,31,More feasible assessment parameters include salivary and urine melatonin measures.
Sleep Disorders,2,32,"'’°° Despite their high prevalence, circadian rhythm sleep—wake disorders are commonly mis- diagnosed as insomnia or, in some situations, hypersomnia."
Sleep Disorders,2,33,"A recent study of patients diagnosed with primary insomnia demonstrated that 10%-22% had a bedtime out of phase with their circadian sleep time, suggesting a circadian etiol- ogy for their sleep problems.~' This misdiagnosis may lead to unsuccessful, expensive, and sometimes harmful conse- quences."
Sleep Disorders,2,34,Treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders are based on timed bright or blue light (morning for delayed and after- noon for advanced phase disorders) and melatonin (1 hour prior to required bedtime in delayed phase disorder).
Sleep Disorders,2,35,"'° For non-24-hour sleep—wake phase disorder, in blind individu- als, Tasimelteon has been recently found helpful."
Sleep Disorders,2,36,It is also helpful to counsel patients that the accuracy of the timing of any interventions for delayed sleep—wake phase disorder may be crucial to successful treatment.

Sleep Disorders,4,6,Sleep-Disordered Breathing: Obstructive Sleep  Apnea and Central Sleep Apnea  Sleep apnea is a primary sleep disorder characterized by pauses of breathing during sleep.
Sleep Disorders,4,7,"There are 3 main types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and complex sleep apnea."
Sleep Disorders,4,8,"An obstructive apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, and results from the collapse of the upper away during sleep."
Sleep Disorders,4,9,"By con- trast, during a central apnea, the interruption of airflow occurs when there is a lack of effort to breathe—usually arising from the brain respiratory centers to the muscles that control breathing."
Sleep Disorders,4,10,"Some patients present with a combi- nation of both obstructive and central apnea, which is termed complex sleep apnea."
Sleep Disorders,4,11,"Sleep apnea can be diagnosed during polysomnography, where the severity of sleep apnea is quantified by the num- ber of respiratory events per hour of sleep."
Sleep Disorders,4,12,"Along with clini- cal symptoms, at least 5 events per hour (Apnea-Hypopnea Index >5) are required for a diagnosis of sleep apnea."
Sleep Disorders,4,13,"** According to prevalent criteria, an Apnea-Hypopnea Index between 5 and 14 will be considered mild sleep apnea, between 15 and 29 moderate sleep apnea, and more than 30 events per hour is considered severe sleep apnea."
Sleep Disorders,4,14,Several screening scales for sleep apnea have been developed to identify at-risk patients.
Sleep Disorders,4,15,"One of the most frequently used in clinic is the STOP-BANG questionnaire,’ which contains 4 yes-or-no questions that relate to clinical signs of sleep apnea (S: snoring; T: tiredness during daytime; O: observed apnea; P: high blood pressure), as well as 4 items related to  the well-known sleep apnea risk factors (B: body mass index >35; A: Age >50 years; N: Neck circumference > 40 cm; G: male gender)."
Sleep Disorders,4,16,"A patient is at high risk of sleep apnea if 3 or more questions are positively answered.~*  In the general middle-aged population, moderate to severe sleep apnea can be found in about 30%-50% of men and 11%-23% of women."
Sleep Disorders,4,17,"**”° Clinical symptoms include most often loud snoring, choking/gasping, apneas witnessed by the bed partner, excessive sleepiness and fatigue, and morning headache."
Sleep Disorders,4,18,Sleep apnea has debilitating effects on the patient and their family’s quality of life.
Sleep Disorders,4,19,"When left untreated, sleep apnea can also have major negative health consequences; it increases the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases."
Sleep Disorders,4,20,"*’ In a large cohort study, risk of stroke in men with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea increased incrementally with each unit of increased severity.°* Sleep apnea is also a well- known risk factor for cognitive deficits.°” The negative con- sequences of sleep apnea can be, at least partially, reversed by consistent and accurate treatment."
Sleep Disorders,4,21,Several treatment options are available.
Sleep Disorders,4,22,"For mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, conservative therapies such as weight loss and avoiding supine position (for positional sleep apnea) can be helpful."
Sleep Disorders,4,23,The most widely used and cur- rently first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is pos- itive airway pressure therapy.
Sleep Disorders,4,24,"Continuous positive airway pressure consists of a continuous flow of air into the nose, while bilevel therapy provides a higher pressure on inspira- tion and lower level on expiration."
Sleep Disorders,4,25,The latter is sometimes more comfortable with higher pressures.
Sleep Disorders,4,26,Auto-titrating machines have been very helpful to expedite treatment.
Sleep Disorders,4,27,Adaptive servo-ventilation can also be used to treat com- plex sleep apnea.
Sleep Disorders,4,28,"Continuous positive airway pressure ther- apy in obstructive sleep apnea individuals has been found to reduce subjective daytime sleepiness, improve cognitive"
Sleep Disorders,5,1,"296  The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 132, No 3, March 2019     functioning, as well as mood and quality of life.°°-** It also  can improve blood pressure and glucose control."
Sleep Disorders,5,2,"** Oral appliances such as mandibular advancement devices may also help to improve mild to moderate cases of obstructive sleep apnea that are not associated with any significant risk factors, or for patients who are intolerant to positive airway pressure therapy."
Sleep Disorders,5,3,"Surgical treatment methods include, most commonly, soft palate surgery, nasal surgery, and maxillo- mandibular surgery."
Sleep Disorders,5,4,"These may help sleep apnea severity, although they generally do not cure sleep apnea."
Sleep Disorders,5,5,"Hypersomnia: Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia  When evaluating hypersomnia, the following issues should be considered: Is there enough sleep opportunity?"
Sleep Disorders,5,6,"In adults, typical sleep need is more than 7 hours, with adequate, con- sistent timing."
Sleep Disorders,5,7,"Are there factors that impair sleep quality and, as a result, lead to insufficient/poor quality sleep?"
Sleep Disorders,5,8,"These include medications and environmental factors, as well as primary sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and sleep-related movement disorders."
Sleep Disorders,5,9,"Does it recur more than 3 times per week, for more than 3 months?"
Sleep Disorders,5,10,Disorders causing central hypersomnia are rare.
Sleep Disorders,5,11,"They include narcolepsy type 1 (with cataplexy), narcolepsy type 2 (no cataplexy), idiopathic hypersomnia (with long sleep time or without long sleep time), and recurrent hypersom- nia (such as Kleine-Levin syndrome)."
Sleep Disorders,5,12,"Narcolepsy is a disor- der of rapid eye movement sleep regulation.’ Classic symptoms include sleepiness, sleep paralysis, and hypnago- gic hallucinations."
Sleep Disorders,5,13,"Cataplexy in narcolepsy type | consists of a loss of muscle tone, provoked typically by positive emotions, classically, laughing or telling a joke."
Sleep Disorders,5,14,"Occasion- ally, surprise or anger can be a trigger."
Sleep Disorders,5,15,"Classically, in nar- colepsy, any daytime naps are short (15-40 minutes) and refreshing."
Sleep Disorders,5,16,"There is a common genetic association (DQB1*0602 haplotype), and patients with narcolepsy type 1 may also have lower orexin measured in cerebrospinal fluid.°>°°  The diagnosis is made first clinically; however, an objec- tive documentation using multiple sleep latency test is needed to confirm the sleepiness."
Sleep Disorders,5,17,This test is typically per- formed on the day after a polysomnography and consists of 5 nap opportunities.
Sleep Disorders,5,18,"Most narcolepsy patients fall asleep within minutes of being given the opportunity, and thus a short sleep latency (average of <8 minutes over the 5 naps), as well as rapid eye movement sleep during these naps would be supportive of narcolepsy (see Figure)."
Sleep Disorders,5,19,Cur- rent criteria require that rapid eye movement sleep is either seen in 2 or more naps or that rapid eye movement is seen in one nap along with a rapid eye movement latency <15 minutes on the preceding polysomnogram.
Sleep Disorders,5,20,"Haplotype typ- ing may be performed; however, it is difficult to interpret and depends on genetics."
Sleep Disorders,5,21,Cerebrospinal fluid measurements of hypocretin are performed in many European countries but are not currently commercially available in the US.

Sleep Disorders,5,23,"“W” delineates waking stage, N1-3 the non-rapid eye move- ment stages 1-3, respectively, and the black solid bars indicate rapid eye movement sleep."
Sleep Disorders,5,24,The green bars delineate each nap opportunity.
Sleep Disorders,5,25,"Sleep is seen in all 5 nap opportuni- ties, occurs within a few minutes of the lights out, and rapid eye move- ment sleep occurs in 3 of the 5 naps."
Sleep Disorders,5,26,Treatment of the sleepiness typically starts with modafi- nil or armodafinil.
Sleep Disorders,5,27,"If these are not tolerated or ineffective, stimulants (methylphenidate or amphetamine/dextroam- phetamine) can be used."
Sleep Disorders,5,28,"Cautions should include monitor- ing blood pressure and evaluating for arrhythmias, which can be worsened by these medications."
Sleep Disorders,5,29,None of these have been approved for use in pregnancy.
Sleep Disorders,5,30,Cataplexy responds to antidepressants (typically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI]) or sodium oxybate.
Sleep Disorders,5,31,"Common comorbid- ities of narcolepsy include rapid eye movement behavior disorder, present in as much as 10% of narcolepsy patients,’ as well as periodic limb movement of sleep."
Sleep Disorders,5,32,"Both may be worsened by SSRI, including the ones used for the cataplexy treatment."
Sleep Disorders,5,33,"Hypersomnia can sometimes be seen after head trauma, in some reports affecting as much as half of the patients with traumatic brain injury,” Sanda quarter of these patients may have sleep-disordered breathing."
Sleep Disorders,5,34,"Treatment of sleep- disordered breathing may be helpful, and use of any sedat- ing medications should be judicious."
Sleep Disorders,5,35,"In rare conditions, hypersomnia can be idiopathic."
Sleep Disorders,5,36,"This condition typically presents with long, nonrefreshing naps."
Sleep Disorders,5,37,"Two types exist: 1) with a long sleep time, and 2) without long sleep time."
Sleep Disorders,5,38,"The criteria for diagnosis include the clini- cal presentation, as well as supportive evidence from the multiple sleep latency test: a sleep latency <8 minutes, no sleep-onset rapid eye movement."
Sleep Disorders,5,39,"Treatment is often chal- lenging, modafinil or armodafinil at higher doses can be used, and sometimes other stimulants can be helpful."
Sleep Disorders,5,40,"In another rare condition, Kleine-Levin syndrome, hypersom- nia is recurrent."
Sleep Disorders,5,41,"Kleine-Levin syndrome typically presents in adolescence or the early 20s, and consists of periods that last for approximately 2 weeks, during which patients"
Sleep Disorders,6,1,"K. Pavlova and Latreille Sleep Disorders  297     exhibit very long sleep (often 12-21 hours per day), and during the waking periods individuals exhibit cognitive abnormalities (eg, major apathy, confusion, slowness, amnesia), dream-like behavior, hyperphagia, or hypersexu- ality."
Sleep Disorders,6,2,"Between episodes, individuals have a normal level of functioning."
Sleep Disorders,6,3,"Treatment with lithium may decrease the fre- quency of episodes, while stimulants have a marginal effect during the events."
Sleep Disorders,6,4,"*°“°  Parasomnias: Non-Rapid Eye Movement Parasomnias and Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder  Parasomnias can be grouped by type of behavior seen, or based on sleep stage from which they occur."
Sleep Disorders,6,5,"The most com- mon non-rapid eye movement parasomnias include som- nambulism, confusional arousals, and night terrors."
Sleep Disorders,6,6,"These parasomnias are characterized by a wide variety of behav- iors, but they mostly occur from slow-wave sleep, and as such, they typically arise in the first half of the night."
Sleep Disorders,6,7,They most commonly manifest with directed behaviors.
Sleep Disorders,6,8,They are not stereotypic and may have a variable duration.
Sleep Disorders,6,9,"Upon awakening, the patient does not have any vivid dream recall."
Sleep Disorders,6,10,"If any dream mentation is recalled, it is very brief or fragmented."
Sleep Disorders,6,11,"The pathophysiology of non-rapid eye move- ment parasomnias is not well understood, although the hypothesis of dysregulated slow-wave sleep has been pro- posed.*!"
Sleep Disorders,6,12,"Treatment may involve benzodiazepines, or in some cases, tricyclic antidepressants."
Sleep Disorders,6,13,"Clinicians should be aware that some medications may induce somnambulism; according to a recent review, the strongest evidence for medication-induced sleepwalking was found for zolpidem and sodium oxybate."
Sleep Disorders,6,14,"**  Rapid eye movement parasomnias, particularly rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, have been stud- ied more extensively."
Sleep Disorders,6,15,"Typically, the patient with rapid eye movement behavior disorder will present with abnormal behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep."
Sleep Disorders,6,16,Dream enactment behaviors result from the loss of the normal muscle atonia seen during this sleep stage.
Sleep Disorders,6,17,They occur mostly in the latter part of the night and consist of a wide variety of motor activity that appears to be related to a dream.
Sleep Disorders,6,18,"If the patient awakens during that time, he/she would be frequently able to recall the dream, which is consistent with the behavior exhibited, and is often elaborate."
Sleep Disorders,6,19,"The type of behavior that most commonly brings the patient to medical attention is often violent, such as screaming, punching, kicking, or other such movements, however, nonviolent activity can be seen as well."
Sleep Disorders,6,20,"Along with a history of recurrent dream-enactment behaviors, the diagnosis is confirmed by nocturnal polysom- nography, which shows typical muscle activations during rapid eye movement sleep or in some cases may record the abnormal events."
Sleep Disorders,6,21,"This sleep disorder is frequently linked with neurodegenerative conditions, particularly synucleino- pathies."
Sleep Disorders,6,22,"** Differential diagnosis includes other parasomnias,  conversion disorders, and seizures."
Sleep Disorders,6,23,"Unlike seizures, rapid eye movement behavior disorder events are directed, and are not stereotypic."
Sleep Disorders,6,24,Identifying association with a dream is also very helpful.
Sleep Disorders,6,25,"The most commonly used agent for treating rapid eye movement behavior disorder is clonazepam,** which has to be used with caution in patients with dementia and may lead to excessive sedation."
Sleep Disorders,6,26,"Due to the strong association with neurodegenerative conditions, patients are likely to have contraindications for benzodiazepine treatment."
Sleep Disorders,6,27,Another option is melatonin—an inexpensive and safer option.
Sleep Disorders,6,28,"*>~*” In one recent study, melatonin was found to be equally effective as clonazepam for reducing the frequency of dream-enactment episodes."
Sleep Disorders,6,29,"**  Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep  Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation, leading to an urge to move the limbs that occurs or worsens while at rest, with consistent evening predomi- nance, associated with dysesthesia, and is partially relieved by physical activity."
Sleep Disorders,6,30,"Patients often describe the sensation as “creeping, crawling tingling” or shock-like feelings, or sim- ply indescribable discomfort."
Sleep Disorders,6,31,"Over the course of the disease, the sensations can spread to the arms or trunk."
Sleep Disorders,6,32,"One of the major characteristics of restless legs syndrome is its worsen- ing in the evening and at night, which results in difficulty ini- tiating sleep, as patients often get up and pace around the room to relieve the discomfort."
Sleep Disorders,6,33,"In turn, poor sleep often leads to fatigue and daytime sleepiness."
Sleep Disorders,6,34,"Restless legs syndrome is one of the most common sleep-related movement disorders, affecting about 15% of adults.“° Generally, it affects women more than men, and prevalence is also higher with advancing age.” The cause can be idiopathic or secondary."
Sleep Disorders,6,35,"In its idiopathic form, there is no known cause, but most patients will have a family his- tory."
Sleep Disorders,6,36,"Secondary restless legs syndrome most often has a later-onset course, and is associated with various neurologi- cal disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease), iron deficiency (low ferritin level), or pregnancy."
Sleep Disorders,6,37,The diagnosis is made by clinical history.
Sleep Disorders,6,38,Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement of sleep frequently co-occur; the latter is present in 80% to 90% of patients diagnosed with restless legs syndrome.
Sleep Disorders,6,39,The presence of periodic limb movement in sleep is also supportive for the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome.
Sleep Disorders,6,40,"Periodic limb move- ment of sleep can be diagnosed by clinical history, but a polysomnography may be useful to confirm the diagnosis, particularly in patients with unexplained symptoms of insomnia or hypersomnia."
Sleep Disorders,6,41,"Multiple studies highlight an important role of brain iron levels in the pathology of restless legs syndrome and peri- odic limb movement of sleep, but these are usually lower in patients with restless legs syndrome."
Sleep Disorders,6,42,*” Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system has also been demonstrated as a potential pathophysiological mechanism for restless legs
Sleep Disorders,7,1,"298  The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 132, No 3, March 2019     syndrome."
Sleep Disorders,7,2,Evaluation of serum ferritin level is recom- mended.
Sleep Disorders,7,3,"If ferritin is below 50 ug/L, replacement of iron should be considered."
Sleep Disorders,7,4,"Otherwise, pharmacological treat- ment of restless legs syndrome may start with either dopa- mine agonists or gabapentin or gabapentin enacarbil."
Sleep Disorders,7,5,"Levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline, and pergo- lide are all considered efficacious."
Sleep Disorders,7,6,The doses of dopamine agonists should be kept as low as possible to decrease the possibility of worsening symptoms over time (termed aug- mentation).
Sleep Disorders,7,7,"Other efficacious medications include pregaba- lin, and rotigotine."
Sleep Disorders,7,8,"In more advanced disease, when other medications are no longer effective, or in the setting of severe augmentation, opiates can be considered."
Sleep Disorders,7,9,Intrave- nous ferric carboxymaltose and pneumatic compression devices were reported likely efficacious in idiopathic rest- less legs syndrome.
Sleep Disorders,7,10,Clonidine and bupropion seem to have insufficient evidence for efficacy at this time.”  A challenging long-term complication of restless legs syndrome is the development of augmentation.
Sleep Disorders,7,11,This phe- nomenon consists of earlier occurrence and worsening of the symptoms.
Sleep Disorders,7,12,"For example, a patient who presented with typical symptom onset around bedtime (10-11 pm) reports that symptoms now occur in the early evening or afternoon, likely suffers from augmentation."
Sleep Disorders,7,13,"To decrease the likeli- hood for augmentation, initial treatment may consider gabapentin or gabapentin enacarbil instead of any dopa-  mine agonists.°~  CONCLUSION  Sleep is vital for all living species, and as it comprises roughly one-third of our lives, when disrupted or perturbed, it can have significant negative consequences on quality of life and daytime function, and therefore, sleep disorders should be promptly treated."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,2,"While various hypotheses of why brains evolved nightly dreaming have been put forward, many of these are contradicted by the sparse, hallu- cinatory, and narrative nature of dreams, a nature that seems to lack any particular function."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,3,"Recently, research on artificial neural networks has shown that during learning, such networks face a ubiquitous prob- lem: that of overfitting to a particular dataset, which leads to failures in generalization and therefore perfor- mance on novel datasets."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,4,"Notably, the techniques that researchers employ to rescue overfitted artificial neu- ral networks generally involve sampling from an out-of-distribution or randomized dataset."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,5,"The overfitted brain hypothesis is that the brains of organisms similarly face the challenge of fitting too well to their daily distribution of stimuli, causing overfitting and poor generalization."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,6,"By hallucinating out-of-distribution sen- sory stimulation every night, the brain is able to rescue the generalizability of its perceptual and cognitive abil- ities and increase task performance."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,7,SUMMARY  Understanding of the evolved biological function of sleep has advanced considerably in the past decade.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,8,"However, no equivalent understanding of dreams has emerged."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,9,"Contemporary neuroscientific theories often view dreams as epiphenomena, and many of the proposals for their biological function are contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,10,"Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,11,"Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when performance on one dataset in- creases but the network’s performance fails to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training versus testing datasets)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,12,This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers via “noise injections” in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,13,The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain’s overfitting during its daily learning.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,14,"That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic activity across the hierarchy of neural structures."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,15,"Sleep loss, spe- cifically dream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize appro- priately."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,16,Herein this ’overfitted brain hypothesis” is explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing contemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,1,17,"Existing evidence for the hypothesis is sur- veyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable predictions is put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in silico."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,2,"It is notable that approximately 50% to 70% of the time sub- jects report having a dream upon a sudden waking during sleep, with more dreams being reported later on in the night."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,3,"'°'' Re- ports from those who keep regular dream journals, or who spend time each morning recollecting dreams, indicate that preserving a memory of dreams increases significantly with practice."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,4,'* All this hints that individuals may regularly underestimate how much time they actually spending dreaming during sleep.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,5,The phenomenology of dreams is different from that of waking experience.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,6,"'° However, few contemporary theories appropri- ately account for the phenomenology of dreams, particularly their sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative contents."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,7,What is the purpose of this strange state?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,8,The fact that sleep overall has some relationship to learning was known even by the Roman orator Quintilian.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,9,"'* Yet, as is discussed in detail in the next sec- tion, contemporary neuroscientific theories which relate dreaming to memory storage, memory replay, or emotional pro- cessing, still view dreams themselves as epiphenomena."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,10,This lack of viable theories about why animals dream stands in contrast with how much is known about sleep physiology and its stages.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,11,"'° As originally discovered by lesion studies and later supported by genetic knockout studies, the sleep state is brought about by a far-reaching set of subcortical neuromodula- tory systems, with no one system being necessary, indicating redundancy in how the waking state is sustained."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,12,"'° In general, this multifaceted arousal system is excitatory during wake in that it has the greatest firing, and becomes more quiescent to bring about sleep, although this is not true for all such systems, especially those that establish rapid eye movement (REM)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,13,"A classic signature of sleep are slow waves, which are waves of activity that traverse the cortex, which can be identified when the dominate frequency of electroencephalogram (EEG) is less than 1 Hz."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,14,"In this state, the cortex become bistable, oscillating between periods of intense firing and periods often referred to as “down states” wherein neurons are silent."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,15,"In general, it should be noted that there is a spectrum wherein sometimes a brain re- gion is experiencing slow wave sleep and this is not synchro- nized with other regions.’ This is despite the fact that sleep itself is traditionally broken down into non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, with REM sleep being more associated with dreaming than NREM sleep."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,16,"Yet there is evidence that dreaming occurs regularly throughout the night, across different sleep stages, '° although it is rarest in the “deepest” stage of NREM, stage 3, wherein surface EEG reflects low-frequency cortical slow waves."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,17,"Recent neuroimaging and sudden-waking experi- ments have demonstrated that all sleep stages can have dreams, which are the result of localized wake-like firing."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,18,"'° On average, high-frequency EEG signals in posterior areas of the brain were most correlated with reports on waking."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,19,"Despite the ubiquity of dreams, it is still the case that REM is most strongly associated with dreaming, more than 80% to 90% of the time in some awakening studies, although it should be noted again that sleep involves a spectrum wherein it is difficult to find any stage at any time of the night that does not contain any dreams at all.°° Although early on in the night dreams can present them- selves as more “thought-like” and simple, later on in the night,  2 Patterns 2, May 14, 2021  Patterns  particularly during REM, dreams can become incredibly com- plex with a fully developed narrative structure.’ Therefore, while the story of dreaming occurring solely during REM has been complicated, it is true they are still associated."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,20,"As far as is currently known, dreaming of is a brain-wide state where the brain is experiencing a single narrative or event, which is supported by the activation of the default-mode network dur- ing dreaming.”° Consider, for instance, the evidence from sud- den-waking experiments that higher frequency activity in the frontal lobe predicted emotional affect within the subject’s dream."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,21,"?° Or consider the evidence that during lucid dreaming, activity is similar to waking movements in the sensorimotor cortex."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,22,"**  Despite the nuances and redundancies of the cortical systems in play, it still makes sense to view the change from dreamless sleep to dreaming as occurring via a brain-wide neuromodula- tory system that regulates level of consciousness, such as by the increase in firing of acetylcholine-containing neurons during REM."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,23,"Neuromodulatory systems also create the conditions of muscle atonia during dreaming, without which dreams can be acted out by the body during sleep, a dangerous parasomnia called REM sleep behavior disorder.”°  What is the overall evolved purpose or function of sleep?"
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,24,"The evidence of distinct physiological states brought about by neuro- modulation suggests answering this requires identifying multiple functions, particularly for dreamless sleep versus dreaming."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,25,"Across the Tree of Life, sleep as a whole is highly conserved; most mammals spend somewhere between 4 and 20 h sleeping."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,26,"*° There is even evidence that Caenorhabditis elegans sleeps.”’ In the past 2 decades there has been significant prog- ress when it comes to understanding the evolved function of sleep as a whole, although this has not been true for dreams themselves."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,27,"First, a novel discovery has led to a clear purpose for at least ine aspect of sleep."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,28,"This was the discovery of the brain’s glym- phatic system, showing that sleep involves the brain-wide flush- ing of metabolites with cerebral spinal fluid.”° This led to the the- ory that sleep, especially during slow wave activity, had the goal of waste clearance and this is at least partly behind sleep’s restorative aspect."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,29,Glymphatic activity in the form of this flushing is low in waking but high during both sleep and while under certain types of anesthesia.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,30,"In sleep and also under anesthesia, the greatest amount of flushing occurs during slow wave sleep when low-frequency delta power dominates the EEG,”° indi- cating that it may be anticorrelated with dreaming, although this has not been explicitly established."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,31,"Dreams may still occur during these flushing events; indeed, it is unknown if the function of dreams might even change depending on sleep stages or background neurophysiological conditions."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,32,"Another important theory of the purpose of sleep is the Synap- tic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY).°° According to SHY, daily learning leads to net synaptic potentiation across the brain, which, if left unchecked, would lead to a saturation of synaptic weight and a cessation of learning.°’ SHY hypothesizes that slow waves trigger a brain-wide down-scaling of synaptic weights."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,33,This indiscriminate down-scaling ensures that the rela- tive weights of synapses are kept proportional while removing the risk of saturation.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,2,34,SHY has served as a model neuroscientific theory in that it has generated a number of new empirical  °
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,1,"Patterns  findings.°° At the same time, it has also triggered fecund debate and investigation.°° Traditionally, SHY is more associated with slow wave sleep than with the high frequencies that indicate dreaming."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,2,"It has also not been explored how SHY faces the problem that a global down-scaling of synapses could easily fail to keep the pattern of synaptic weights the same, since neu- rons are nonlinear mechanisms."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,3,"Even a net down-scaling of an artificial neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions would likely affect its function if the scaling dropped any weights below zero; in the case of sigmoid activation func- tions, it would significantly impact function, and in an un- known way."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,4,"The overall evidence indicates that sleep can be broken into two parts: during dreamless sleep metabolic clearance and cellular it is likely that repair occurs, and some form of unknown contribution to improvements in performance and learning on tasks occurs during dreaming.” Ultimately, this purpose of the dreaming phase or aspect of sleep lacks hypotheses as explicit and clear as those for slow wave sleep."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,5,"*°  In order to offer forward a distinct theory of the purpose of dreams, this paper outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of overfitting, which is the lack of gener- alizability that occurs in a deep neural network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset, and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,6,This is the overfitted brian hy- pothesis (OBH).
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,7,"The goal of this paper is to formally fill-out the OBH by investigating the evidence that the brain fits to a dataset composed of the statistically similar daily experiences of the or- ganism, while nightly dreams improve the generality and robust- ness of an animal’s representations, cognition, and perceptual systems, by generating data far outside the organism’s daily “training set” in a warped or corrupted way.°° This idea is sup- ported by the idea that stochasticity (such as corrupted or sparse inputs) is critical in machine learning.°” As will be discussed, the OBH fits with known biological understanding and data, matches better with dream phenomenology than most other the- ories, draws various antecedents and similar approaches under one specific roof, and additionally has roots in common prac- tices in deep learning."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,8,It makes unique predictions that can be tested both via computational modeling and also in vivo.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,9,CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF DREAMS  A hypothesis for the evolved purpose of sleep must outline a clear and distinct function from other aspects of sleep.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,10,"It must also explain how dreams present themselves, that is, the phe- nomenology of dream experience."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,11,"Specifically, it must explain why dream phenomenology is different from wake phenomenol- ogy."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,12,Consider three phenomenological properties unique to dreams.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,13,"First, the sparseness of dreams in that they are generally less vivid than waking life in that they contain less sensory and conceptual information (i.e., less detail)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,14,"This lack of detail in dreams is universal, and examples include the blurring of text causing an impossibility of reading, using phones, or calcula- tions.°° Second, the hallucinatory quality of dreams in that they are generally unusual in some way (i.e., not the simple repetition of daily events or specific memories)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,15,"This includes the fact that in dreams, events and concepts often exist outside of normally strict categories (a person becomes another person, a house a  © CelPress  OPEN /     spaceship, and so on)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,16,"Third, the narrative property of dreams, in that dreams in adult humans are generally sequences of events ordered such that they form a narrative, albeit a fabulist one."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,17,"As we will see, the OBH posits it is not in spite of these prop- erties that dreams serve their evolved purpose, but because of them."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,18,"This section explores existent theories of dreams, the support- ing evidence (or lack thereof) and how they fail to integrate well with, or explain, dream phenomenology."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,19,"Dreams are for emotional regulation  The idea that dreams are important for emotional health is a descendant of Freudian theories of psycholanalysis.°° While Freud’s theories of dreams as expressions of taboo frustration are discredited, there is still a historical association between dreams as expressions of, or important for, emotional pro- cessing."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,20,"The specific proposals for how dreams impact emotional regulation involve hypotheses like that dreams are somehow for fear extinction.“° Such hypotheses reason that dreams might act somewhat like cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for phobias, wherein they provide a safe space for “rehearsals” to- ward fearful things in order to make them less frightful.’ Yet there is no evidence that the fears of nightmares are the kind of irrational fears faced by those with phobias, nor that fears to- ward nightmarish events in general should be attenuated, as fear is evolutionarily quite useful."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,21,Another kind of theory is that dreams act much like an “emotional thermostat” in order to regulate emotions.*?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,22,":*> From dream journals there is some evidence that more emotional dreams predict better recovery from disorders like depression, “* although sample size for this sort of research is prohibitively small throughout oneirology."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,23,"From neuroimaging there is evi- dence that emotional processing centers like the amygdala show greater activity during REM even than during wake,“° although the role of the amygdala ranges widely from emotions to rewards to motivations.“° There is some evidence that changes in REM sleep indicate mood disorders."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,24,"*’ However, this is not unique to only REM sleep, as NREM sleep is also changed or reduced in mood disorders,*® and many cognitive disorders show sleep problems in general.’° Sleep deprivation does appear to lead to emotional issues such as a lack of emotional inhibition and also irritability.°° But such failures of appropriate function holds true across many cognitive pro- cesses following sleep deprivation, including executive function, which would affect emotional regulation.’  Overall, the hypothesis that dreams are for resolving emotional conflicts specifically does not have overwhelming empirical evi- dence."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,25,"It is also not supported by the phenomenology of dreams, which, at least in general, are not emphatically emotional."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,26,"Indeed, emotionally neutral dreams are common."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,27,"Overall there appears to be a slight bias to dreams to have negative affect,°° although this may simply be that dreams that have high emotional valence are memorable (and it is worth noting that in studying dream reports joy/elation was the next most common to anxiety/fear)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,28,"Given the evidence it seems likely that whatever the evolved purpose of dreams is, its function can affect emo- tions, but there is no strong evidence that dreaming has evolved specifically for emotional regulation."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,3,29,"Patterns 2, May 14, 2021 3"
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,1,"   Dreams are for memory consolidation  Perhaps the leading contemporary theory is that dreams some- how involve memory consolidation and storage,”® often via a proposed form of memory replay.°* The dominant metaphor for this theory of consolidation is that of the computer: memories need to be “stored” somewhere in the brain, like storing a com- puter file on a hard drive, and therefore there must be a storage process."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,2,"This viewpoint is held by much of traditional cognitive neuroscience, wherein the goal of the brain is to “store” mem- ories as veridically as possible,°° although there is growing recognition that veridical “computer-like” storage is not desir- able for complex learning and that forgetting is just as impor- tant.°° According to the memory consolidation hypothesis, memory storage occurs during dreams, or alternatively dreams, by accessing previously stored memories, strengthen them, or that somehow dreams are a byproduct of integrating new mem- ories with older ones."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,3,"There is a significant line of research that draws from this the- ory, including many neuroimaging studies, and a full review of the literature would be beyond the scope of this paper.°” However, there is also debate."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,4,"Specifically the consolidation hypothesis is both very broad and rarely meant to specify just dreams rather than sleep in general.°° For example, there is evidence that learning a new task leads to a greater activation during both REM’?"
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,5,"and slow wave sleep” in the task-relevant cortical areas, which indicates there is no preferential consolidation during dreaming."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,6,"This is true even when comparing a wake/sleep con- dition versus a control condition without sleep but over the same time, which has found that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity increased in associated brain regions with the task.°' But these sorts of neuroimaging studies are not very specific, since increased activation in relevant areas does not actually mean storage, nor replay, nor integration with existing memories."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,7,"Indeed, they could be interpreted just as easily for ev- idence of the OBH (see “Evidence from neuroscience”)."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,9,"Replay was originally discovered in the hippocampus of rats,°*°° although the original analysis was again for slow wave sleep, not correlating this process to dreaming specifically."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,10,"Indeed, the same statistically increased firing in correlated neu- rons that counts as “replay” occurs during quiet wakefulness, indicating it has nothing specific to do with dreams.” In general, if two neurons potentiate at the same time and from the same cause, they are more likely to be correlated in the sense of increased firing in the future, regardless of whether they are re- playing anything specific, a view supported by the finding that “replay” events are much faster in terms of their firing.°°  There are a number of significant issues with the specific hy- potheses that dreams are replaying memories.” First, offline replay of episodic memories may not actually assist memoriza- tion; since ground truth is absent offline, such replays might actually introduce errors."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,11,"Indeed, neuroscience has shown that re-accessing memories generally changes them, rather than en- forces them.°°'°’ Due to the issues in assuming that specific memories are actually replayed, a number of authors have pro- posed more complex theories of consolidation, such as that the idea there exists two complementary learning systems and  4 Patterns 2, May 14, 2021  Patterns  replay connects these two systems together.°° Furthermore, the hypothesis must grapple with the fact that well-controlled neuroimaging experiments show little evidence for exact sequence replication and strong evidence for mostly never- before-seen firing patterns.°° In light of this sort of evidence, some have argued that sleep promotes gist extraction from spe- cific memories,’°:’' although these sorts of hypotheses have not specifically been about dreaming."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,12,"Overall, replay is unlikely to be the purpose of dreams, since, as previously discussed, based on the most detailed studies on dream reports after awakenings, dreams are not connected or, at most, only vaguely connected with the day’s events."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,16,"Indeed, there is significant evidence that episodic memory and dreams are dissociated.’° While there is behavioral evidence that repetitive daily tasks, like having subjects play Tetris for sig- nificant periods of time, can lead to Tetris-inspired dreams, such inculcated images or sequences do not represent replay in that they are not veridical repeats of previous games, being more hallucinatory and sparse in content and only being loosely related to the played game, such as dreaming of playing some altered version of a maze game after being exposed to it during the day.’° Moreover, dreams triggered by such repetitive games appear even in patients completely lacking all memory, those with clinically diagnosed amnesia.”° It can take several days for repetitive tasks to show up in dreams, a form of “dream lag,” and almost always these tasks appear in partial forms that are, again, only loosely similar.°' Overall, the behavioral ev- idence suggests that dreams are not replays of memories or waking events."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,4,17,"There is a strong line of evidence from Tetris-studies to sudden wake-ups to dream-lag effects showing that partial or loosely similar dreams can be triggered most reliably by recently learned tasks, and yet such inculcated dreams generally take the form of never-before-seen experiences or sequences with the traditional dream-like properties of sparseness and hallucination, matching no specific memory but rather a seeming exploration of the state-space of the task itself."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,5,9,This is because “reverse learning” approaches differ significantly by focusing on how specific memories are destroyed (via anti-learning mechanisms like a hypothetical “reverse Spike-timing-dependent plasticity”) rather than how corrupted inputs or top-down noise can improve generalization like in the OBH.

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,7,"In general, in such theories the phe- nomenology of dreams is accounted for by the breakdown of the perception-action loop during dreaming: essentially the brain’s activity is dominated by its “priors” rather than bottom-up input."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,8,"Some predictive processing proponents have put forward views that the role of dreams is not actually to test inferences about ac- tions, but to improve a hypothesized generative model (in this context a model used by brain to make predictions), specifically by reducing this generative model’s complexity by pruning redundant synapses."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,9,"''° According to this hypothesis, the pro- posed evolved purpose of dreaming during REM sleep is to mini- mize the free energy of the brain."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,11,"Specifically, the hypothesis put forward in Hobson and Friston''® is that syn- aptic pruning (of the kind proposed in SHY during slow wave sleep)*’ can help minimize model complexity (and therefore help minimize the free energy) since overall parameters of a model are reduced when synapses are pruned."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,12,"However, SHY actually specifies that there is a net reduction of synaptic weight specifically so that waking activity is generally unaffected by this change, and additionally it is also specifically associated with NREM and slow wave sleep rather than REM and dreaming."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,19,"For instance, if dreams were about creating optimal prior beliefs or improving a model’s self-consis- tency by minimizing input-less prediction errors (as in Hobson and colleagues''’), the consequence would be that dreams should become less surprising throughout development as input-less prediction error is minimized."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,6,28,"It is also worth noting that the free energy principle approach to dreaming is highly spe- cific in how this is accomplished by the minimization of errors ina generative model’s predictions of itself without inputs, rather than via how corrupted or stochastic inputs assist generalization as in the OBH."

The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,19,"Indeed, it explains the link between crea- tivity and dreaming better than the hypotheses that dreaming  8 Patterns 2, May 14, 2021  Patterns  is for the integration of new with old memories, the replay of memories, or their storage."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,20,"Finally, it might be argued that it is a problem for the OBH that dreams are generally amnesiac, with explicit memory a rarity during dreams."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,21,Would it not be strange then that the content of dreams have any effect on the abilities of a neural network?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,22,"Here, an important distinction should be made between access- ing explicit declarative memories and the general fact that learning involves changes to synapses."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,23,"For instance, the amne- siac effect during sleep may due to prefrontal inhibition."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,24,"Just as prefrontal cortex inhibition means that dreams are not recogniz- able as dreams when they are occurring, it may be that the same inhibition makes it difficult to recall in the sense of cognitive ac- cess.”' Anecdotal evidence from those with dream journals sug- gests that paying attention to dreams makes them easier to remember, lending credence to this hypothesis."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,25,"'° In addition, sudden-waking experiments show that dream content is com- mon and recallable."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,26,Likely the effects of not being able to either form or access episodic memories of all dreams at the end of the night are due to the neuromodulatory milieu during sleep.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,27,"Supporting the OBH is evidence indicating that dreams lead to synaptic changes in the connectivity of the brain, albeit likely this is not as strongly as waking experience, with episodic memory storage significantly reduced."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,28,What is the evidence that synap- ses change during sleep?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,29,"Proponents of SHY have argued that there is evidence that synapses change during sleep in the form of synaptic homeostasis, regularization which occurs every night in the form of universal down-scaling of synaptic strength.°* However, this has been challenged by the observa- tion of potentiation during sleep."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,30,"'“° In general it appears that whether there is net potentiation or depression during waking depends on the task, '“' indicating that learning involves synaptic plasticity in both directions in both wake and sleep."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,31,"‘“° If during dreams synapses are indeed still plastic, then dreams can leave asynaptic trace that can affect performance."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,32,"However, it should be noted that as of yet there is no strong empirical evidence that the content of dreams can lead to synaptic changes and learning as the content of waking experience does, and this is difficult to explore experimentally."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,33,"Evidence from deep learning One of the most significant, and ubiquitous, challenges any deep neural network faces is the ability to generalize beyond the data- set it has been trained on, that is, to avoid simply memorizing the dataset."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,34,"There has been significant effort in the past decade by the deep learning community to develop methods and tech- niques to avoid overfitting on particular datasets and, at the broadest level, to allow for extrapolation to never-before-seen datasets."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,35,This section overviews three commonly used such techniques within deep learning (and research into artificial neu- ral networks generally).
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,36,"Notably, each of these three techniques embodies some phenomenological property of dreams and also fits with what is known about the neurophysiology of dreaming."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,37,"The first technique is the data augmentation method of dropout, perhaps the most widely used technique for preventing overfitting in deep learning."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,38,"'“° Dropout occurs during the training of a network, when inputs are made sparse by randomly “drop- ping out” some of them, a form of regularization during learning which is mathematically similar to a noise injection."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,8,39,'°° It is
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,1,"Patterns  important to note that dreams resemble dropout in their spare- ness, as they do not contain as much perceptual information, or details in general, as waking experiences."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,2,"For example, phones are generally unusable in dreams because there is not enough phenomenological detail to support such small icons and text."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,3,"This likely increases the salience of relevant features while minimizing irrelevant features, assisting in generalization by making representations more robust and invariant, since one reason dropout is successful is that it acts like an averaging effect over different models the data could be drawn from."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,4,"Dreams are a lesser or weakened state of conscious experience because of this dropping out of bottom-up stimuli, lacking much of the detail of waking conscious experiences."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,5,"This, according to the OBH, actually assists, rather than hinders, their function."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,6,The second technique that supports the OBH is the method of domain randomization used in training DNNs.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,7,"In domain randomization, the inputs during learning are “randomized” in the sense of being warped or corrupted in particular ways."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,8,This can drastically assist with learning and generalization.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,9,"Paradox- ically, simulating hallucinatory inputs rather than learning off of real inputs helps deep neural networks learn real-world tasks."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,10,"'““ Domain randomization has have been used in cutting-edge tech- niques in deep learning, such as being necessary for having a DNN solve a Rubik’s Cube using a robot hand."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,11,"'*° Domain randomization resembles the hallucinatory quality of dreams in that dreams depart significantly from normal experiences, as if they have been randomly drawn from a varied set of different domains."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,12,"The third common practice in deep learning that has ties to dreaming is the use of some generative model to expand the training set of the neural network, which can assist in learning various tasks."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,13,Generative models lie behind the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other techniques that allow for cutting-edge performance on complex tasks us- ing sets of feedforward networks that anticipate the other’s output.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,14,'“° It is worth noting that GANs and others often pro- duce notoriously dream-like fabulist outputs.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,15,"'“’ Indeed, recently an external generative model that created “‘dream- like” input helped train a DNN to produce the code behind a given mathematical mapping."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,16,"'“° It has been shown that input created from a generative model can indeed assist with learning, such as preventing catastrophic forgetting."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,17,"'“° It should be noted that in most these cases the generative model exists outside the network itself, which is not biologi- cally realistic in the case of the brain, although there are some exceptions."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,18,'°° What of those cases where the network itself acts the generative model?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,19,This is much closer to the case of the dreaming brain.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,20,"In networks that are not purely feedforward or have external models that can be manipulated by experimenters, the stimulation of higher layers (generally through the injection of noise) can lead to patterns of activity in the lower layers that recapitulate the statistical properties of inputs, as if the network were being stimulated from the bot- tom-up from imaginary sources (this is similar to the wake- sleep algorithm discussed in “Dreams benefit predictive pro- cessing by refining generative models”)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,21,"This is likely the case in the brain, wherein stochastic activity high in the hier- archy of brain regions creates hallucinatory patterns of inputs via feedback connections."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,22,"© CelPress  OPEN /     Indeed, it is likely the case that dreams are indeed a result of noise in the brain’s hierarchical structure that traverses its feed- back connectivity, which fits with the evidence that dreams are “top-down.”'°' This further fits with evidence that dreaming drawn from the brain’s model of the world becomes more narra- tive and complex over time, particularly during adolescence."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,23,"'°* By adulthood, dreams take on the narrative structure of human cognition wherein stories and metaphors and events make up the core function of thought."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,24,"'°° Since narratives are the way by which human brains understand the world, '°* stochastic stimu- lation of the hierarchical structure of the brain produces narra- tives, which act as hallucinatory and sparse bottom-up input for learning, thus combating overfitting and improving general- ization."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,25,"In this way they are a direct expansion of the normal “training set” of an animal, since narratives and events are how conscious perception itself proceeds and understands the world."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,26,"‘°°  The OBH claims that dreams resemble a combination of these three techniques: a sparse, corrupted, or randomized set of sen- sory inputs, which are likely created by feedback exploiting the hierarchical nature of the brain as a generative model, and the purpose of these experiences is to expand and regularize the limited and biased “training set” of the organism to prevent over- fitting."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,27,"Of course, the precise implementation of these tech- niques (such as their combined nature) must be different for the brain than in deep learning research."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,28,This is because the brain faces many challenges that artificial neural networks do not.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,29,Any organism that implemented dropout or domain random- ization during its daily learning would face serious survival is- sues.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,30,"Therefore, in order to increase generality and avoid overfit- ting and pure memorization of waking sensory input a dedicated offline period is needed."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,31,"Sleep, possibly having originally evolved for other housekeeping reasons, is the perfect time."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,32,"Overall, the overlap between the phenomenology of dreams and common methods in the field of deep learning for mitigating overfitting, avoiding pure memorization, and assisting general- ization lend credence to the idea that the evolved function of dreaming is for precisely these purposes."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,33,PREDICTIONS  The OBH puts together several lines of investigation under one roof by being explicit about asking how generalization during learning can benefit from dreams.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,34,"This involves understanding how dreams can help overcome an organism’s reliance on memorizing just a day’s events, which is often highly statistically biased."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,35,The theory makes a number of specific predictions which can be pursued both experimentally as well as theoretically.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,36,Experimental validation  Experimental investigation of the OBH within neuroscience can consist of several components.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,37,"Under the OBH, much of the benefit of dreaming is in the realm of generalizability not memo- rization per se, and this can be differentiated with well-designed behavioral tests."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,38,"For example, it may be that direct measurement of overfitting is possible in humans."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,39,This may include the training of subjects on overly repetitious tasks in order to ensure the con- dition of overfitting.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,9,40,"It may also include using similar techniques  Patterns 2, May 14, 2021 9"
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,1,e CelPress     as those within deep learning to test for generalization of per- formance.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,2,"In animal models there have not been explicit attempts to separate out the difference between pure memorization and generalization, and the effect of sleep deprivation on each."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,3,"Ac- cording to the OBH, memorization should be less affected by sleep deprivation than generalization."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,4,"Therefore, using mouse models of things like context fear generalization'°° could be examined under conditions of sleep deprivation or, if possible, dream deprivation."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,5,"Beyond behavioral predictions and subse- quent studies, there is also the possibility of attempting to track synaptic plasticity in response to dreams."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,6,"This may include things like tracking changes in dendritic spine morphology dur- ing REM, such have been used to track spine morphology changes during sleep to investigate SHY."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,7,"'°”  Notably, the sort of cognitive flexibility and generalization the OBH claims is the purpose of dreams is highly important for workers and those in the armed forces who sometimes operate under sleep deprivation during critical periods, which can lead to increased accident rates,'°° and has a significant monetary annual impact."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,8,"'°° If it is true that sleep-deprived brains are over- fitted, they will be prone to make errors in stereotypical ways."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,9,Thus it may be easier to know what types of mistakes will be made by individuals operating in sleep-deprived states and in response build more robust fail-safes.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,10,"Furthermore, the OBH predicts there may be the possibility of dream substitutions: dream-like stimuli that are artificially gener- ated to have the properties of dreams, and therefore have a similar ameliorative effect on overfitting."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,11,"Such dream substitu- tions, delivered via virtual reality (VR) or even video, might pro- vide a simple yet effective means for delaying some of sleep dep- rivation’s cognitive defects."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,12,"For example, it may be that a pilot who has been flying for a long period of time is beginning to over- fit to their task, and a quick but intense exposure to an entirely different sort of visual stimulus (like a dream-like nature scene in VR) could stave off some of the effects of sleep deprivation."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,13,The impact of substitutions can be examined both behaviorally but also at the neurophysiological level of REM rebound.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,14,"‘°°  Theoretical validation  The OBH has consequences not just for neuroscience, but also for the field of deep learning."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,15,"This is particularly true of biologi- cally realistic models, like large-scale thalamocortical spiking- neuron models, which have previously been used to investigate the development of cortical connectivity and its effect on slow waves."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,16,'°' It is likely that biologically realistic spiking neurons that are still trainable in the manner of DNNs‘®* can be used to explore the benefits of dreams directly.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,17,"In such a cortical model, neuromodulation can be used to be intersperse training with pe- riods that mimic sleep stages, cycling first through the real input of its training set, and then hallucinatory corrupted input gener- ated from its top-down connections."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,18,This should prevent or delay overfitting.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,19,What sort of stochastic biases allow for dreams to warp input data in a way that is most efficient for avoiding overfitting?
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,20,"If the OBH is correct, then the sparse and hallucinatory nature of dreams suggests that we should expect warping of input distri- butions that successfully combats overfitting has these qualities."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,21,"Such distributions should be sparse in that they have less entries  10 Patterns 2, May 14, 2021  Patterns  than normal inputs, and hallucinatory in that they should be clus- tered in a different way compared to the standard “daily” input."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,22,This can be directly tested in state-of-the-art DNNs as well as more biologically realistic artificial neural networks.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,23,"That is, there may be a point of criticality where inputs have been altered to be as dream-like as possible and this is the most effective means of preventing overfitting in biologically realistic artificial neural net- works, which can be tested by exploring how differently corrup- ted inputs assist in generalization."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,24,"In addition, since learning is diurnal in the brain, it may mean that adjusting to mimic realistic patterns of cyclical dream-like activity could have the most beneficial effect in machine learning generally."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,25,A final further po- tential hypothesis is that a reduction to the learning rate (given the neuromodulatory milieu of dreams that likely blocks the for- mation of strong memories) during dream-like input could be especially beneficial for learning in DNNs.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,26,"DISCUSSION  The OBH posits the evolved purpose of dreams is to assist generalization by stochastic corruptions of normal sensory input, which combats the highly biased nature of inputs during an ani- mal’s daily learning that can lead to overfitting, a ubiquitous problem in artificial neural networks and machine learning in gen- eral."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,27,"It is supported by both empirical evidence (Evidence from neuroscience”) and theoretical evidence (""Evidence from deep learning”)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,28,In many cases it can explain observed results better than other hypotheses (comparative hypotheses are discussed in “Contemporary theories of dreams”).
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,29,"For example, it seems the most effective way to trigger dreams about something is to have subjects perform on a novel task like Tetris repeti- tiously,’°''®° likely because the visual system has become over- fitted to the task."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,30,"In addition, the OBH fits with the fact that “replay” results more often contain never-before-seen patterns of activity than actual replays of waking sequences,”° a fact that, as has been pointed out in the previous literature, indicates that dreaming may play some sort of role in generalization or gist extraction.’° In another example, the OBH also explains the fact that synaptic potentiation occurs during sleep, '“° indicating that learning during dreams themselves leaves behind a synap- tic trace."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,31,"The OBH does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses about sleep, for instance, the idea that during certain periods of sleep there is ongoing metabolic waste clearance.”® In this sense then the OBH speculates that dreaming evolved as an ex- aptation, wherein sleep evolved for molecular housekeeping purposes, and only when brains had to significantly learn during the organism’s lifetime did the goal of avoiding overfitting and increasing generalization become adaptive."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,32,"The OBH does not even contradict some hypotheses about dreams, instead adding new dimensions."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,33,"Examples of this include the hypothesis that dreams are a test-bed for strengthening the brain’s ability to generate mental imagery during wake, explaining the complexi- fication of dreams from childhood to adulthood."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,34,'*° Another example of a novel hypothesis that does not stand in opposition to the OBH is that dreams are for defending neural real estate'°° (although this may be contradicted by non-wake activation pro- files during dreaming).
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,10,35,"As a hypothesis, it shares similar back- ground concerns with that of the free energy approach to"
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,1,"Patterns  dreaming, ''® although without assuming that dreams are for testing the predictions of a generative self-model’s priors or that dreams should become less surprising over time as input- less prediction error is minimized."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,2,"There also appears to be possible room for overlap between SHY, the OBH, and the reverse learning hypothesis of dreaming (see “Dreams are for se- lective forgetting”)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,3,"Overall the OBH should be viewed as flexible and an umbrella hypothesis with many antecedents; after all, itis merely the formal proposal that the corrupted, warped, and sto- chastic nature of sensory input in dreams serves to improve per- formance on the brain’s daily tasks, motivated by the phenome- nology of dreams and common practices in deep learning."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,4,"It is also worth noting that within the OBH dream’s role in improving generalization may include related things like combating “catastrophic forgetting,” which is a problem faced by DNNs that try to train on multiple tasks, and which can also be prevented or alleviated by methods like dropout or more complicated techniques like elastic weight consolidation.’ Recent research shows that stimuli created from stimulation of a network’s top-down connections (which are, according to the OBH, similar to dreams), can indeed help avoid catastrophic forgetting."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,5,"'°° So while issues like catastrophic forgetting (the complete unlearning of a task while learning another) is not well documented in humans, it may be that individual brain mod- ules or networks face some lesser form of it, and dreams can be conceptualized as a form of regularization that may ameliorate several aspects of common learning failures simultaneously."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,6,"For example, beyond the improvements in both in- and out-of- distribution generalization, the stochasticity and spareness evinced in the phenomenology of dreams can also likely improve things like security in response to adversarial attacks and overall computational efficiency, as stochastic stimulation has these ef- fects in DNNs.°’ Perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of the OBH is that it takes the phenomenology of dreams seriously, in that they are sparse, hallucinogenic, and narrative in the sense of containing fabulist and unusual events (and while the relation- ship between phenomenology and neural activity remains un- known, contemporary theories exist that attempt to map the relationship)."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,7,"'""°° The OBH emphasizes that it is precisely because of the departure from waking life that dreams evolved."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,8,"According to this hypothesis, dreams are not epiphenomena, either in the sense of neutral evolution but also in the sense of not being an expression of some other background process, such as patterns of activity and associated experiences merely brought about by some other processing integrating new mem- ories.°’ Rather, the point of dreams is the dreams themselves, because they provide departures away from the statistically biased input of an animal's daily life, which can assist and there- fore increase performance."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,9,"It may seem paradoxical, but a dream of flying may actually help you keep your balance running."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,10,"The evidence for this possibility comes from common methods in deep learning that improve generalization, such as dropout, ‘7° domain randomization, '** and the use of input data created by stochastic stimulation of generative models, '“° which together bear striking similarities to the properties of dreams."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,11,The OBH makes several predictions that are useful for both the field of neuroscience and the field of deep learning.
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,12,"These include predictions on the neurophysiological level, as well as behavioral, and even within the field of deep learning."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,13,"For  © CelPress  OPEN ACCESS  instance, the prediction that inputs with dream-like properties (i.e., adhering to dream phenomenology) will assist with overfit- ting in DNNs."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,14,"Behaviorally, overfitting might be induced in sub- jects via repetitive training on an undersampled task, and the benefit of dreaming might be directly measured."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,15,"There is also the possibility of dream substitutions, wherein artificial dream- like stimuli might help improve generalization and therefore per- formance in sleep-deprived individuals."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,16,"Finally, it is worth taking the idea of dream substitutions seri- ously enough to consider whether fictions, like novels or films, act as artificial dreams, accomplishing at least some of the same function."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,17,"Within evolutionary psychology, the attempt to ground aspects of human behavior in evolutionary theory, there has been long-standing confusion with regard to human interest in fictions, since on their surface fictions have no utility."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,18,"They are, after all, explicitly false information."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,19,"Therefore it has been thought that fictions are either demonstrations of cognitive fitness in order to influence mate choice,'°’ or can simply be reduced to the equivalent of “cheesecake” — gratifying to consume but without benefit."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,20,"Proponents of this view have even gone so far as to describe the arts as a “pleasure technol- ogy.”'°° Some researchers have proposed benefits to fiction consumption, like improving theory of mind'®° or helping to ab- stract social norms."
The overfitted brain- Dreams evolved to assist generalization,11,21,"'’° The OBH suggests fictions, and perhaps the arts in general, may actually have a deeper underlying cogni- tive utility in the form of improving generalization and preventing overfitting by acting as artificial dreams."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,7,Heart failure (HF) affects an increasing number of individuals all over the world every year.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,8,"Severe HF is the leading cause of hospital admissions in elderly patients’, and mortality remains high despite the progress in treat- ment strategies."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,9,"However, a limitation of many studies on the evaluation and management of chronic HF is their focus on the assessment of patient characteristics during daytime only, when the patient is awake."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,10,"This approach assumes that the mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of HE, and the factors related to the clinical progression of this condition, can be satisfac- torily explored during daytime hours and that no rele- vant information can be obtained by investigating these patients during sleep."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,11,"This general belief is challenged by the growing awareness of the presence of important problems during sleep in patients with HE, among which are short sleep time and low sleep quality."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,12,"Patients with HF often complain of sleep fragment- ation or nonrestorative sleep, difficulties in initiating sleep, or waking up too early in the morning."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,13,"Epidemio- logical data show a higher prevalence of chronic insomnia in patients with HF than in the general popu- lation (33% versus 10-15%)’, sometimes related to mood disorders and psychological stress."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,14,Many factors might affect sleep quality and duration in patients with HF.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,15,"which includes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and central sleep apnoea (CSA), is common in patients with HF and has been suggested to increase the morbidity and mortality in these patients."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,16,"Both OSA and CSA are associated with increased sympathetic activation, vagal withdrawal, altered haemodynamic loading conditions, and hypoxaemia."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,17,"Moreover, OSA is strongly associated with arterial hypertension, the most common risk factor for cardiac hypertrophy and failure."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,18,"Intrathoracic pressure changes are also associated with OSA, contributing to haemodynamic alterations and potentially affecting overexpression of genes involved in ventricular remodelling."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,19,HF treatment can decrease the severity of both OSA and CSA.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,20,"Indeed, furosemide and spironolactone administration, exercise training, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and eventually heart transplantation have shown a positive effect on OSA and CSA in patients with HF."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,21,"At present, whether CSA should be treated and, if so, which is the optimal therapy is still debated."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,22,"By contrast, more evidence is available on the beneficial  Some patients can have primary or psychophysiologi- cal insomnia that might not be caused by the HF treat- ment."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,23,"In other cases, insomnia can be of secondary nature, possibly caused by the HF itself or by adverse effects of commonly prescribed HF medications, such as angiotensin-receptor blockers, loop diuretics, and B-blockers’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,24,"In these cases, the complaints that are associated with HF might cause the insomnia and the related symptoms, and could be markedly improved by appropriate HF management."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,25,"Nocturia is also com- monly reported by patients with HE, and is often sug- gested as a cause of poor sleep quality together with nocturnal dyspnoea and orthopnoea' (BOX 1)."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,1,27,"This effect on HF outcomes is a result not only of the intrinsic alterations of ventilation, but also because sleep apnoeas can have a role in other sleep alterations, for example, through the sleep fragmentation secondary to recurrent apnoeas or because concomitant sleep-disordered breathing can affect both primary and secondary insomnia, worsening the related symptoms’."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,1,"REVIEWS  Key points     ¢ Patients with heart failure (HF) are characterized by relevant problems during sleep, including short sleep time, low sleep quality, and sleep-disordered breathing  ¢ Approximately 33% of patients with HF have insomnia, potentially related to HF features, adverse effects of medications, or to conditions that often accompany chronic diseases such as mood disorders and psychological stress  e ACC/AHA guidelines have identified sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality as barriers to self-care and treatment adherence in patients with HF  ¢ Sleep-disordered breathing is highly prevalent in patients with HF; both central and obstructive sleep apnoeas are frequently observed in these patients, and were shown to have an important added prognostic value  © Continuous positive airway pressure has a beneficial effect on left ventricular ejection fraction and is currently the best treatment option for obstructive sleep apnoeas in  patients with HF  ¢ At present, no consensus exists on whether central sleep apnoeas should be treated and what the optimal therapy in HF might be  Finally, poor health-related quality of life is common in adult patients with HF’, and sleep disorders (with or without daytime sleepiness) can greatly contribute to these symptoms’*."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,2,"Therefore, the presence of sleep dis- orders might be an additional risk factor for increased mortality in patients with HE ACC/AHA guidelines’ identify sleep deprivation and poor quality of sleep — often associated with low sustained attention, poor memory, impaired executive function, and psychomotor delay — as barriers to self-care and treatment adherence in patients with HE."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,3,"This Review addresses the complex interactions between HF and sleep alterations, in particular with sleep-disordered breathing, and describes the patho- physiology, diagnosis, and management of these sleep disorders on the background of increasing evidence from clinical studies."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,4,"Importantly, the evidence from clinical trials is not yet well integrated into the current HF management guidelines, exemplified by the 2012 ESC guidelines on HF"" in which sleep-disordered breathing is referred to only as a possible HF comorbid- ity and for which the possibility of treatment might be considered."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,5,"Therefore, in this Review, we aim to raise the awareness among clinicians of issues related to sleep-disordered breathing in HF and their manage- ment."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,6,This Review is especially important following publication in 2015 of the interventional SERVE-HF trial!
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,7,"', designed to assess the effects of adaptive servo- ventilation in patients with chronic HF and central apnoeas, and with two more trials currently ongoing: ADVENT-HE”, which includes patients with chronic HF and obstructive and/or central apnoeas, and CAT-HE"", which includes patients with post-acute decompensated HF."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,8,HF and sleep-disordered breathing  The two major forms of sleep-disordered breath- ing are obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and central sleep apnoea (CSA).
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,9,"OSAs result from the complete collapse of the pharynx and upper airways, whereas CSAs arise from fluctuations in the central respiratory drive."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,10,"During OSA, the abdominal and thoracic efforts  increase with the aim of producing airflow (FIG."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,11,1a).
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,12,"By contrast, respiratory movements are absent in CSA“ (FIG."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,13,1b).
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,14,"OSA and CSA might share a common origin, as the same patient can present with predominantly obstructive apnoeas at the beginning of the night that turn into mainly central apnoeas towards the morn- ing'*""*."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,15,"A third form of sleep-disordered breathing that is also frequent in patients with HF is mixed sleep apnoea, characterized by an initial central apnoea event followed by an obstructive component."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,16,Respiratory patterns characterized by hyperpnoea and central hypopnoea (or apnoea) alternating during sleep were reported to occur in patients with HF more than a century ago.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,17,"First Cheyne in 1818, and later Stokes in 1834, described a periodic breathing pattern that was later named after them as ‘Cheyne-Stokes respiration."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,18,"This condition is a form of periodic breath- ing in which the ventilatory period is characterized by a prolonged waxing and waning pattern of tidal volume, followed by central apnoea or hypopnoea."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,19,"Cheyne- Stokes respiration can be observed during both sleep and wakefulness, although it seems to be more com- mon during sleep’’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,20,Cheyne-Stokes respiration that occurs during sleep is considered a form of CSA with a prolonged hyperpnoea.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,21,"The term ‘CSA is generally used synonymously with Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with HE, although Cheyne-Stokes respiration is actually a special type of CSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,22,"Epidemiology  The prevalence of OSA in otherwise healthy adults varies widely in the literature” and has been reported to be 2-9% in women and 4~26% in men depending on which criteria have been considered for the diagnosis, but with a marked upsurge in prevalence in the past 2 decades” (BOX 2)."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,23,"The prevalence of CSA/Cheyne-Stokes respir- ation in otherwise healthy adults seems to be lower than that of OSA, but no strong evidence has been provided on this issue so far."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,2,24,"Age, sex, sleep stage, and several medical conditions have been reported to affect sus- ceptibility to CSA”””’, Breathing instability, which is ikely to occur at sleep onset when patients can oscillate between wakefulness and various sleep stages, is also a  otential trigger for CSA."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,1,Almost 50% of patients with HF have alterations of ventilation during sleep (central or obstructive apnoeas and hypopnoeas) that can disrupt the positive effects of physiological sleep on the cardiovascular sys- tem?
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,2,"*?>, Nevertheless, most of the available evidence on sleep-disordered breathing refers to patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, and few data are available on patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,3,"In two case series, cross-sectional studies including patients with HF undergoing polysomnography, OSA was detected in 37% and 11% of patients, with the preva- lence of OSA being greater in men (38%) than in women (31%)*?”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,4,"Risk factors for OSA in patients with HE, as in the general population, are multiple and, among them, male sex and being overweight or obese (quanti- fied by the body mass index) have an important role."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,5,"In women, menopausal status, in particular if combined with obesity and age >50 years, are the most impor- tant determinants of OSA”'*, The Sleep Heart Health Study”, a perspective study comprising 6,424 men and women, indicated that the presence of OSA (defined as an apnoea—hypopnoea index (AHI) 210 per h) favoured the appearance of HF independently of other known risk factors, with a 2.20 relative risk."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,6,"In the largest, cross-sectional studies on sleep- disordered breathing in patients with HF with left ven- tricular systolic dysfunction, the frequency of CSA/ Cheyne-Stokes respiration was reported to range between 28% and 82%***8""°-*3, This extremely wide range might depend on a number of variables, including HF aetio- logy and severity."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,7,"The principal risk factors for CSA/ Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with HF identi- fied in cross-sectional studies are male sex, advanced age, hypocapnia, atrial fibrillation™, or presence of a pacemaker, but not obesity’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,8,"Interestingly, women with systolic dysfunction rarely develop CSA/Cheyne-Stokes respiration””*>, Women are less susceptible to the develop- ment of hypocapnic central apnoea than men, and sex- related differences can also be found in the development of periodic breathing at high altitude***’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,9,This sex-related difference in the prevalence of CSA/Cheyne-Stokes respiration might contribute to the higher death rate in men with HF than in female patients with HE  Pathophysiology Obstructive sleep apnoea OSA is caused by the collapse of the upper airways during sleep in patients with anatomically narrowed and highly compliant airways.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,10,This collapse is caused by dysfunction of the motor neurons responsible for controlling the musculature within the pharynx*.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,11,"In patients with HE, additional factors can favour the col- lapse of the upper airways, such as marked oscillations in the ventilatory drive, which lead to periodic breathing and predispose to upper airway narrowing’, and fluid shift from the legs to central structures, including the upper airways, when the patient is lying down (FIG."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,12,2).
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,13,"HF can favour the appearance and severity of OSA, and OSA might, in turn, favour the progression of chronic HF through multiple mechanisms (FIG."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,14,2).

Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,16,This increase in cardiac preload is associated with a leftward shift of the interventricular septum that further reduces left ventricular function’.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,17,"The negative intrathoracic pressure during obstructive apnoea is also responsible for an increased left ventricular transmural pressure, which increases the afterload”, fur- ther impairing the function of an already failing left ven- tricle."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,18,"These recurrent events that accompany repeated obstructive apnoea determine a further increase of the already elevated sympathetic activity in patients with HE, documented by increased plasma catecholamines”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,19,"The repeated occurrence of apnoeas and hypopnoeas has been associated with deranged endothelial function, an increase in the plasma concentration of inflammatory markers, increased platelet aggregability, and increased variability in blood pressure and heart rate“."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,20,"Central sleep apnoea  The arterial partial pressure of CO, (P,CO,) is the most important factor influencing ventilatory drive during both wake and sleep."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,21,"Periodic breathing is character- ized by central apnoea, which occurs when the P,CO, is lowered below the apnoeic threshold‘*”**, followed by a hyperventilation phase."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,22,"Whenever the chemical drive of breathing prevails over the cortical influence on the respiratory controller — as typically occurs during sleep — the patient becomes apnoeic until the P,CO, rises again above the apnoea threshold, accom- anied by a reduction in the arterial partial pressure of O, (P,O,)*."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,3,23,"The alternating pattern of apnoea and yperpnoea continues because of the ongoing oscilla- tions of P,CO, around the apnoea threshold, associated with concomitant oscillations in P,O, (REFS 49-52)."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,4,6,"Overall, CSA/Cheyne-Stokes respiration has been considered in most studies to be more a consequence than a cause of HE."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,4,7,"However, even if patients with HF and CSA are not affected by episodes of negative intrathoracic pressure — as is the case in patients with OSA — they are nevertheless characterized by a high sympathetic acti- vation during both day and night."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,1,"sleep-disordered breathing on cardiovascular function can also be assessed through measurement of the time required for pulse waves to reach peripheral arteries, defined as pulse transit time""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,2,"Pulse transit time can also be used in the assessment of patients with HF and sleep-disordered breathing, with better results when combined with capnography'®."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,3,"Although in-hospital, full polysomnography is still the gold-standard diagnostic test for sleep-disordered breathing, attended polysomnography is a complex test that is expensive and not easily available."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,4,"For these reasons, cardiorespiratory sleep polygraphy has been proposed as a better solution for screening sleep- disordered breathing in patients with a cardiac condi- tion."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,5,"The simplified approach of cardiorespiratory sleep polygraphy enables recording of sleep breathing patterns — chest and abdominal movements, nasal airflow, and oxygen saturation (SpO,) combined with electrocardio- gram (ECG) and body position — at the patient’s home and is, therefore, more easily accepted by the patient than an in-hospital recording."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,6,"Furthermore, cardiorespiratory sleep polygraphy is suggested to be as sensitive as full polysomnography in diagnosing sleep-disordered breathing'**."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,7,"Some cardiorespiratory recorders also offer the possibility of remote data transmission, which is a further advantage in monitoring patients with HF."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,8,A frequently asked question in a cardiology environ- ment is whether easier and simpler tools to screen for sleep-disordered breathing are available.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,9,"Several approaches have been proposed, ranging from a simple recording of heart rate variability or nocturnal SpO, via a finger probe, to a combination of SpO,, ECG, and peripheral pulse wave recordings."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,10,"The simple SpO, recording was shown reliably to identify the occur- rence of marked nocturnal oxygen desaturations in patients with HE, leading to a more accurate screening of sleep-disordered breathing than other tools, such as heart rate variability estimates'*’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,11,"However, SpO, record- ing might not help to detect apnoea and hypopnoea events without marked desaturations, that is, when- ever desaturations are <3%."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,12,"Sleep-disordered breathing management guidelines!” clearly state that, although SpO, monitoring might be a simple and clinically useful screening tool, this recording cannot be used to make a diagnosis because SpO, monitoring cannot be used to determine the type of sleep-disordered breathing, for which a polygraphic recording is required."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,13,A novel approach for the identification of sleep- disordered breathing comes from pacemaker technology.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,14,"In patients with implanted pacemakers, the changes in thoracic impedance associated with ventilation can be assessed through the pacemaker electrodes using an ad hoc algorithm."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,15,"These devices, through the analysis of thoracic impedance changes, can identify moderate- to-severe sleep-disordered breathing with a sensitivity of up to 88.9%, and a specificity of up to 84.6%'*."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,16,"Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to define more precisely the actual clinical role of this technology."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,17,The diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing and the identification of the most suitable indices for their quantification are important steps towards more  REVIEWS  accurate risk stratification of patients with HE.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,18,"Sleep- disordered breathing, by reducing nocturnal oxygen and inducing oxygen desaturation, can substantially affect outcomes in patients with HE, as shown by the largest clinical study on this issue’”’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,19,"Treatment perspectives  Obstructive sleep apnoea  In contrast to CSA, OSA does not seem to be a com- pensatory mechanism in patients with HF and might, therefore, be a target for treatment (TABLE 2)."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,20,No strong evidence is available showing that drugs used for the treatment of HF influence the severity of OSA.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,21,"However, interesting preliminary data show, for example, that treatment with furosemide and spironolactone in atients with severe OSA and diastolic HF is associ- ated with a significant reduction in AHI (from 75 to 57; P<0.001) and a significant increase in upper airway atency'’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,22,"Other general therapeutic considerations for atients with HF and OSA include weight reduction and abstinence from smoke, alcohol, and sedatives (which redispose to pharyngeal collapse during sleep)."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,24,"Continuous positive airway ressure (CPAP) treatment in patients with HF and OSA prevents recurrent hypoxia, reduces nocturnal blood pressure and heart rate”’, and increases arterial baroreflex sensitivity’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,25,In the first study to examine the effects of treating OSA in patients with HE CPAP treat- ment was associated with a significant increase in mean eft ventricular ejection fraction and a reduction in dyspnoea.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,26,"A small cohort study showed that adequate diagnosis and CPAP adherence reduced both hospital readmission rate and emergency department visits of atients with HF over a 30-day observation period""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,27,"Moreover, randomized trials involving patients with HF and OSA treated with CPAP showed an improvement in eft ventricular systolic function and reductions in blood ressure, heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,28,"Accordingly, a meta-analysis also showed that CPAP might improve left ventricular ejection fraction among atients with OSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,9,29,"In terms of long-term clinical outcomes, two observational studies have encouraging results, showing that CPAP treatment lowers mortal- ity‘ and improves hospitalization-free survival'” in atients with HE, particularly in more compliant patients whose average nightly usage of CPAP was higher than the median group use (4.9h)."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,7,"Central sleep apnoea  At present, whether CSA should be treated, or what the optimal therapy of CSA in HF might be, is uncer- tain (TABLE 2)."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,8,"First-line therapy for patients with CSA should be the optimization of HF treatment, which can reduce systemic and pulmonary congestion and, thereby, reduce CSA""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,9,"In patients with HE, reducing the intra- vascular volume and venous congestion with diuretic agents might promote the reduction of OSA and CSA severities by decreasing fluid retention and rostral fluid shift at night."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,10,Pharmacological therapy.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,11,Small studies suggest that acetazolamide and theophylline are beneficial for the treatment of CSA in patients with HF’.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,12,"In sympto- matic patients with CSA, acetazolamide — a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that induces mild metabolic  acidosis —ameliorates CSA when administered in a single, 250 mg dose before bedtime’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,13,"Similarly, theo- phylline reduces CSA in patients with HF'** without adverse effects on sleep architecture."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,14,"However, another trial showed that theophylline did not improve right or left ventricular ejection fraction, quality of life, or clin- ical outcomes'**."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,15,"Additionally, theophylline is associated with important adverse effects in patients with advanced HE, including inotropic and arrhythmogenic effects, precluding the long-term use of this drug’”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,16,"Several pharmacological agents might influence the breathing pattern during sleep, in particular CSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,17,"Therefore, ongoing drug treatments should be care- fully evaluated in the management of patients with HE and CSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,18,An aggressive diuretic therapy com- bined with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and B-blockers can reduce the severity of CSA and the associated sympathetic overactivity'*'.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,19,"However, the metabolic alkalosis that results from the use of diuretic therapies might predispose to CSA by narrow- ing the difference between the circulating P,CO, and apnoeic threshold."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,20,"Conversely, narcotics can worsen central apnoea."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,21,"Therefore, when patients with HF need analgesia, a change in the pain-control regimen might ameliorate the severity of their central apnoea."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,22,"On the basis of the available data, we might conclude that the potential usefulness of pharmacological therapy for CSA is still a debated issue, and that further research is needed in this area."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,10,23,"In addition, the potential interference with respiratory patterns by drugs used for the treatment of other conditions should be carefully considered to avoid iatrogenic worsening of central apnoeas."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,1,"Supplemental O, and CO,."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,2,Accumulating evidence indicates that chemosensitivity might have an impor- tant role in patients with HE.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,3,"Increased chemosensi- tivity to both hypoxia and hypercapnia are suggested as serious adverse prognostic markers in HE, inducing neurohormonal derangement, ventilation instability, and ventricular arrhythmias’*'."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,4,"From a pathogenic point of view, a study in healthy individuals that were tested under exercise, hypoxia, hyperoxia, hyperoxic hypercapnia, and with or without acetazolamide treat- ment, showed that exercise, hypoxia, and hypercapnia increased ventilatory oscillations by increasing cardiac output and breath-by-breath ventilation'®."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,5,"By contrast, acetazolamide decreased ventilatory instability, in part by a contrasting action on O, and CO, sensing’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,6,"Supplemental O, therapy in patients with HF might have beneficial effects on CSA by ameliorating the hypoxaemia, increasing cerebral PCO, through the Haldane effect, and decreasing nocturnal norepineph- rine levels'®*'™, However, supplemental O, did not induce significant improvements in cardiac function or quality of life in patients with HF'®*""®, and the effects of supplemental O, on cardiovascular end points in patients with HF and concomitant CSA over pro- longed periods have not been assessed."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,7,"Furthermore, O, supplementation in patients with ST-segment eleva- tion myocardial infarction but with normoxia might have deleterious effects'**."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,8,"Although chemosensitivity is increased in patients with HF compared with healthy individuals'”, growing evidence also shows a major role of central afferent sympathetic fibres in modulat- ing chemoreflex sensitivity and medullary autonomic centres, Therefore, altered chemosensitivity and increased sympathetic drive seem to be associated in a vicious cycle, and might be causally linked in both directions in patients with HF and concomitant CSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,9,Ventilation during sleep.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,10,"Randomized clinical trials suggest that noninvasive positive airway pressure such as CPAP, bilevel positive airway pressure, and adaptive pressure support servo-ventilation alleviate CSA in patients with HF during periods of 1 day to 3 months'**'”°."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,11,"The beneficial effects of nasal CPAP on CSA, especially if it occurs in combination with OSA, can be explained by a number of mechanisms, such as the improvement in oxygenation by inducing an increase in lung volume, and the improvement of cardiac func- tion by decreasing preload and after load."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,12,"The combin- ation of these changes would modulate the ventilatory overshoot in CSA, thereby antagonizing the perpetu- ation of ventilatory instability, which is also suggested by the increase in P,CO, after CPAP'""'”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,13,Preliminary studies showed that nasal CPAP treatment in patients with HF and CSA was associated with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction and a reduction of the com- bined mortality-cardiac transplantation rate'*’.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,14,"Nasal CPAP treatment also decreased the frequency of ven- tricular ectopic beats'” and nocturnal and daytime sym- pathetic nervous system activity, resulting in improved quality of life**!”""!”*."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,15,"Nevertheless, this combination of beneficial effects has not been confirmed in subsequent  REVIEWS  studies such as the CANPAP trial’”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,16,"Investigators enrolled 258 patients with HF and CSA into this trial, which was designed to assess whether CPAP would improve the survival without heart transplantation in these patients during a 2-year follow-up."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,17,"At 3 months, the CPAP group showed a reduction in the AHI, an increase in ejection fraction and mean nocturnal oxy- haemoglobin saturation, a reduction in the plasma lev- els of norepinephrine, and an improved 6-min walking distance compared with the placebo group."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,18,No differ- ences were found in the overall death and heart trans- plantation rates between the two groups.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,19,"However, the first data analysis had some limitations, acknowledged by the researchers'”*, and a post-hoc analysis showed a decrease in mortality in patients in whom CPAP ther- apy resulted in amelioration of CSA'”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,20,"Interestingly, the responder group (CPAP-CSA-suppressed) had a sig- nificant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at 3 months (P=0.001) and a higher transplantation-free survival than control individuals."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,21,No differences in any of these variables were found in the nonresponder group (CPAP-CSA-unsuppressed).
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,22,"Despite this post-hoc analy- sis, current evidence does not support the use of CPAP to extend life in patients with HF and CSA, in particu- lar in the absence of ventilatory response to treatment demonstrated by polysomnography’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,23,"Bilevel nasal positive pressure, a noninvasive posi- tive pressure ventilation with pressure support mode, is another therapeutic option in patients with both CSA and OSA."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,24,"However, little evidence supports the use of bilevel positive pressure in nonhypercapnic central apnoea, including chronic HF'”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,25,"Preliminary studies have investigated the beneficial effect of bilevel posi- tive airway pressure ventilation in patients with HF and CSAS”, but the results strongly emphasize the need for larger trials to confirm the efficacy."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,26,"The technological progress in the past decade has led to the development of devices for adaptive servo- ventilation, which provide varying amounts of ventila- tory support against a background of low-level CPAP."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,27,"Several studies suggest that adaptive servo-ventilation is more effective than CPAP, bilevel pressure support ven- tilation, or increased dead space in alleviating central sleep apnoea’**'**""*?, However, the large, randomized, controlled SERVE-HF trial’!"
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,28,"has shown that adaptive servo-ventilation has no significant positive effect in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly with CSA, but rather increases both all- cause and cardiovascular mortality."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,29,"All-cause mortality was 34.8% in the adaptive servo-ventilation group and 29.3% in the control group (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55, P=0.01), and cardiovascular mortality was 29.9% and 24.0%, respectively (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65, P=0.006)."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,30,"Two studies on the use of adaptive servo- ventilation in patients with HE, the ADVENT-HE” and CAT-HF* trials, are currently being performed."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,11,31,The ADVENT-HF trial was designed to assess whether sur- vival improves when adaptive servo-ventilation is added to optimal medical therapy in patients with chronic HF affected by both CSA and OSA.

Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,3,"Overall, while waiting for the results of the ongoing trials, we have to conclude that no indication exists for the use of ventilatory adaptive servo-ventilation in the treatment of CSA in patients with HF with reduced ejec- tion fraction, at least not in the frame of randomized, controlled, prospective trials."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,4,"Conversely, optimization of available HF therapies is still the gold standard for the management of patients with HE, and all other treatment options need to be proved safe and of any benefit in HF with reduced ejection fraction before being considered."

Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,7,"In these patients, an increase of pacing rate led to a reduction in the frequency of both central and obstructive apnoeas'**'*°, However, these effects were analysed over a single night recording, with no clin- ical outcome assessment, and without determining the pathogenic mechanisms'****,  Additional therapeutic strategies for CSA in patients with HF include physical exercise, which has been pro- posed as a possible effective therapy both for CSA and OSA'”'88, Cardiac resynchronization therapy might also be useful in this setting, because this intervention was found to reduce the AHI in patients with HF and CSA""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,8,"However, none of the available studies on this issue had a randomized, controlled design."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,9,"Finally, in 2015 phrenic nerve stimulation through a device (Remede®; Respicardia, USA) similar to a pacemaker with a stimu- lating electrode was proposed for the treatment of CSA, and is currently under evaluation in a randomized trial!**."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,10,This device can be implanted percutaneously without general anaesthesia in a catheter laboratory.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,11,"A nonrandomized, pilot study including 57 patients with HF showed that this technique induced a 55% reduction in the mean AHI in 3 months'*’."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,12,"Phrenic nerve stimulation also reduced arousals and oxygen desaturation index, and improved quality-of-life indices, with treatment-related adverse events occurring in 26% of patients!*""."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,13,"In conclusion, the following clinical indications for the management of patients with HF and CSA seem to be supported by evidence."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,14,"First, optimization of the treat- ment for the underlying condition (that is, chronic HF) is of fundamental importance."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,15,"Second, titration of CPAP in the sleep laboratory, aimed at identifying optimal ven- tilation pressure settings through polysomnography, is necessary to ascertain response to nasal positive airway pressure therapy and to determine any long-term bene- fit."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,16,"Third, the use of bilevel positive airway pressure in a pressure support mode might aggravate the severity of central apnoea."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,17,"By contrast, adaptive servo-ventilation is a questionable therapeutic modality for HF and CSA/ Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and before suggesting the use of this technique, the results of ongoing randomized  trials need to be awaited and compared."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,18,"Fourth, supple- mental O, might be beneficial, particularly in patients with HF and CSA/Cheyne-Stokes respiration."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,19,"Fifth, the use of pharmacological agents remains of question- able efficacy."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,20,"Additional studies are needed to provide a clearer indication on the management of CSA in patients with HE, also with the perspective of the available novel devices and techniques."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,21,"Insomnia  Guaranteeing sufficient sleep quality and duration in HF is important; therefore, in patients with HE, emphasis should be placed on treating chronic insomnia with cog- nitive behaviour therapy, medication, or both."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,22,"However, the effects of treating insomnia in patients with HF have not been widely explored, and no randomized, controlled trials to assess this issue have been published."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,23,"As in the general population, treatment of comorbid insomnia in patients with HF can be implemented by starting with the collection of detailed patient history and sleep habits."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,24,"In patients with HF, nonpharmaco- logical approaches for insomnia, including sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy, stimu- lus control therapy, and sleep restriction therapy, often seem to be preferable."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,25,"In the case of concomitant sleep- disordered breathing, which can worsen the symptoms of primary and secondary insomnia, CPAP treatment can help to reduce secondary insomnia symptoms’”."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,26,"However, in patients with comorbid primary insomnia, CPAP treatment might be much less tolerated and, therefore, less effective in improving sleep duration and quality."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,27,"Pharmacological therapies for sleep might be clin- ically important, but should have minimal interactions with the drugs used for treating HE."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,28,Patients with HF often require a complex medication regimen and these patients are often characterized by prolonged drug- elimination times.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,29,"Therefore, in these patients sleep agents can lead to an increased risk of daytime sleepiness, in particular when drugs with a long half-life are used."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,30,"In this context, ramelteon — a melatonin receptor ago- nist with both high affinity for melatonin MT, and MT, receptors and selectivity over the MT, receptor — has been suggested as a safe drug to ameliorate sleep in patients with HF'**."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,31,"Other possible drugs are phyto- pharmacological drugs such as valerians, melissa, and L-tryptophan as mild medications, and antihistamines, antidepressants, and benzodiazepine-receptor agonists as more effective hypnotics."
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,32,Benzodiazepines should be strictly avoided owing to the sedative effect on the respiratory centre.
Heart failure and sleep disorders,12,33,"Conclusions  The frequent occurrence of sleep alterations and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with HF, and the evidence of their influence in the HF clinical course, symptoms, and prognosis, strongly indicate that sleep alterations should receive more attention in the management of patients with HE, promoting inter- active collaborations between sleep medicine centres and HF clinics."

Sleep and Human Aging,1,4,What are the underlying neural mechanisms that explain age-related sleep disruption?
Sleep and Human Aging,1,5,This review tackles these questions.
Sleep and Human Aging,1,6,"First, we describe canonical changes in human sleep quantity and quality in cognitively normal older adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,7,"Second, we explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that may account for these human sleep alterations."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,8,"Third, we consider the functional consequences of age-related sleep disruption, focusing on memory impairment as an exemplar."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,9,"We conclude with a discussion of a still-debated question: do older adults simply need less sleep, or rather, are they unable to generate the sleep that they still need?"
Sleep and Human Aging,1,10,Normative aging is associated with a reduced ability to initiate and maintain sleep.
Sleep and Human Aging,1,11,"Moreover, deficits in sleep physiology, including those of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and its associated neural oscillations, are especially prominent in later life."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,12,"Though sleep disruption is a common signature of “normal aging”, the underlying neural mechanisms explaining age-related sleep impairment are only now being revealed."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,13,This review focuses on physiological changes associated with normative human aging.
Sleep and Human Aging,1,14,"First, we characterize associated alter- ations in sleep structure and oscillatory activity in later life."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,15,"Sec- ond, we describe emerging neurobiological mechanisms that may account for these sleep alterations."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,16,"Third, we consider the functional consequences of age-related sleep disruption, focusing on memory impairment."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,17,We conclude with the explora- tion of a still-unresolved question: are older adults unable to generate the sleep that they need or do they simply need sleep less.
Sleep and Human Aging,1,18,What about Sleep Changes with Age?
Sleep and Human Aging,1,19,"Both the macro-level structure of sleep, such as sleep duration and sleep stages, and the micro-level architecture of sleep, including the quantity and quality of sleep oscillations, change as we progress into our older age."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,20,"Macro Sleep Changes  Advancing into the fifth decade of older age and beyond are a collection of well-characterized changes in sleep architecture (Figure 1A): (1) advanced sleep timing (i.e., earlier bedtimes and rise times), (2) longer sleep-onset latency (i.e., longer time taken to fall asleep), (3) shorter overall sleep duration, (4) increased sleep fragmentation (i.e., less consolidated sleep with more awakenings, arousals, or transitions to lighter sleep stages), (5) more fragile sleep (i.e., higher likelihood of being wo- ken by external sensory stimuli), (6) reduced amount of deeper NREM sleep known as slow wave sleep (SWS), (7) increased time spent in lighter NREM stages 1 and 2, (8) shorter and fewer NREM-REM sleep cycles, and (9) increased time spent awake throughout the night (Conte et al., 2014; Feinberg and Carlson, 1968; Kales et al., 1967; Klerman and Dijk, 2008; Landolt et al.,  1996; Ohayon et al., 2004; Redline et al., 2004; Van Cauter et al., 2000; Vienne et al., 2016; Webb and Campbell, 1979; Zepelin et al., 1984)."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,21,This is not to suggest a lack of individual variability in the degree of sleep disruption.
Sleep and Human Aging,1,22,"It is clear that some older adults show little sleep impairment, while others show dra- matic alterations, despite chronological age being similar (Redline et al., 2004; Vitiello, 2009), a topic that we will return to throughout this review."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,23,"Though age-related reductions in REM sleep time have been reported, these are subtler relative to changes in NREM sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,24,"Often, REM sleep impairments only emerge as adults progress into their 80s and beyond (Ohayon et al., 2004; Van Cauter et al., 2000) or as asymptom of degenerative dementias (Brayet et al., 2015; Hita-Yafiez et al., 2012; Petit et al., 2004) (discussed in Box 1)."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,25,"The frequency of diurnal naps also increases in later life: 10% of adults ages 55-64, and 25% ages 75-84, report the occur- rence of daytime naps (Foley et al., 2007)."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,26,"Across these older age groups, roughly half of these naps are unplanned."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,27,"This is consistent with the finding that 1 in 4 older adults report experi- encing daytime sleepiness severe enough to impair daytime plans on a regular basis (Foley et al., 2007) and may reflect many of the characteristic nighttime sleep abnormalities described above (e.g., more fragmented sleep, less total sleep time, and less slow wave sleep)."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,28,"Excessive daytime sleepiness and daytime napping are not, however, a universal feature of old age."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,29,"For some portion of older adults, daytime sleep propensity and daytime ratings of subjec- tive sleepiness diminish with the transition from midlife into older adulthood (Dijk et al., 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,1,30,"One factor that appears to deter- mine whether older adults are prone to daytime napping and excessive daytime sleepiness is the presence of comorbid conditions such as chronic pain, depression, sleep disorders, and frequent nighttime urination breaks (Foley et al., 2007; Vitiello, 2009)."

Sleep and Human Aging,2,14,"Therefore, discrepancies in reported daytime sleepiness in older adults—increases or decreases— appear to depend, at least in part, on the time of day and/or circadian preference of the individuals being compared."
Sleep and Human Aging,2,15,"This is of further relevance given the fact of advances in circadian pref- erence in older age, wherein older individuals shift to earlier wake times and earlier bed times (Monk, 2005)."

Sleep and Human Aging,2,17,"Significant reduc- tions in SWA are already observed in middle-aged adults, relative to young adults, and this SWA_ impairment becomes especially prominent in older adults (Dijk et al., 1989; Landolt and Bor- bély, 2001; Landolt et al., 1996; Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,2,18,"Importantly from a mechanistic and detection perspective, this age-related decrease in SWA is not evenly expressed in terms of head topography or sleep cycle across the night."
Sleep and Human Aging,2,19,"Rather, maximal age-related decrements in absolute SWA are observed over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) derivations and in the first NREM sleep cycles, with reductions of 75%-80% on average relative to young adults (Figure 1B) (Dijk et al., 1989; Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Landolt et al., 1996; Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,2,20,"Slow wave activity is intimately bound with the homeostatic drive to sleep following continued wakefulness; the longer an in- dividual remains awake, the greater the pressure to sleep and the greater the amount of subsequent SWA during sleep (Borbély,  48plo  eee Buno,"

Sleep and Human Aging,3,2,"Sleep, Neuropathology, and Abnormal Aging  Beyond normative aging, sleep disruption is especially pervasive in neurodegenerative dementias."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,3,"To date, the majority of path- ological evidence concerns B-amyloid (Af) protein and tau neurofibrillary tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,4,"Subjective and objective measures of poor sleep correlate with cortical AB burden, as well as cerebrospinal fluid measures of AB and phosphorylated tau (Liguori et al., 2014; Mander et al., 2015; Spira et al., 2013; Sprecher et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,5,"Similar associations have been observed in animals, with AB accumulation in rodent models of AD predicting greater sleep fragmentation (Roh et al., 2012)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,6,"Recent studies in humans have further established that AB is selectively associated with the loss of <1 Hz NREM sleep os- cillations (Mander et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,7,"This association between AB and <1 Hz NREM oscillations appears to be unique and distinct from general age-related reductions in the broader SWA range of 0.6-4.8 Hz; with the latter linked, instead, to gray matter atrophy within the medial prefrontal cortex (Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,8,"Af further correlates with reduced REM sleep amount in healthy older adults (Mander et al., 2015) and patients with AD (Liguori et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,9,"This link may be connected to degeneration of REM-regulating cholinergic neurons projecting from the basal forebrain to the cortex (Brayet et al., 2015; Gag- non et al., 2008; Hassainia et al., 1997; Moraes et al., 2006; Petit et al., 2004), though direct evidence remains lacking."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,10,"In addition to AB, tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles within the medial temporal lobe are believed to represent an early stage in AD disease progression (Bouras et al., 1994; Delacourte et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,11,"Tau regional aggregation is relevant given the role of the hippocampus in generating ripples that are time locked to the expression of NREM sleep spindles and slow waves, hypothesized to support sleep-dependent declarative memory processing (Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Staresina et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,12,"Fitting this over- lap, tau within the rodent brain is associated with disrupted NREM oscillations, leading to abnormally long (slow) hyperpolarized down state and a reduction in successful transitions to the depolarizing up state of the slow wave (Menkes-Caspi et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,13,"In human studies, tau levels within cerebrospinal fluid are associated with diminished slow wave sleep in AD patients (Liguori et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,14,"Further supporting this tau-NREM oscillation hypothesis, both patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD have significantly fewer posterior NREM fast sleep spindles relative to healthy older adults, with the degree of spindle reduction predict- ing the severity of memory impairment (Gorgoni et al., 2016; Rauchs et al., 2008)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,15,"However, studies are needed to verify which neuropathological factor explains this loss of posterior spindles and, if tau, whether this association is specific to AD or present in other tauopathies."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,16,"Beyond the medial temporal lobe, AD post-mortem studies have established that neurofibrillary tangles within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus correlate with the severity of prior fragmented sleep (Lim et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,17,"Interestingly, tau deposition is also present in other sleep-regulating areas such as the locus coeruleus and basal forebrain and can be observed even in cognitively normal older adults (Braak and Del Tredici, 2016; Braak et al., 2011; Stern and Naidoo, 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,18,"This leads to the currently untested hypothesis that tau within these regions may trigger sleep abnormalities years before degenerative disease onset and, if such sleep disruption is specific, could serve as an early diagnostic biomarker (Holth et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,19,It is additionally becoming clear that the link between degenerative dementia conditions and sleep disruption is bi-directional.
Sleep and Human Aging,3,20,"Work in mice has revealed an interacting mechanism, such that Af levels increase with time spent awake, while NREM sleep predicts the clearance of AB (Kang et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,21,"In cognitively normal older human adults, those with greater initial levels of sleep frag- mentation go on to suffer a more rapid subsequent rate of cognitive decline and a higher risk of developing AD over an ensuing six-year period (Lim et al., 2013a, 2013b)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,22,"These bi-directional relationships are observed before the onset of disease and, further- more, independently of sleep disorders that also increase dementia risk, such as insomnia or sleep apnea (Osorio et al., 2011; Yaffe et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,23,"It suggests that inadequate sleep is not only a predisposing risk factor contributing to degenerative disease processes, but represents a novel treatment opportunity and/or even preventative strategy in this context (Mander et al., 2016a)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,24,"In summary, dementia-related neuropathologies are associated with forms of sleep disruption that are uniquely distinct from typical age-related sleep disruption or, in some cases, a significantly more severe form of those same sleep impairments."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,25,The former is especially relevant in the context of sleep as a non-invasive and possible early biomarker distinguishing normal from abnormal aging.
Sleep and Human Aging,3,26,1982).
Sleep and Human Aging,3,27,"In young adults, SWA is highest in the first NREM cycle of the night and then exponentially declines in intensity across suc- cessive NREM sleep cycles, reflecting a homeostatic dissipation of sleep pressure (Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Landolt et al., 1996) (Figure 2A)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,28,"This process of homeostatic sleep regulation, including SWA, is also altered as a function of aging."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,29,"First, the exponential slope of SWA dissipation across the night is shallower in older relative to younger adults (Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Landolt et al., 1996) (Figure 2A), suggesting less of a homeostatic discharge in aging."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,30,"Second, homeostatic increases in slow wave sleep time and SWA in response to prolonged prior wakefulness (that is, sleep deprivation), or selective slow wave sleep suppres-  sion, are blunted in older relative to younger adults (Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Munch et al., 2004) (Figure 2B)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,31,"This latter finding has been interpreted as an impairment in the homeostatic regulation of SWA in older adults (Dijk et al., 1999)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,32,"Similar to the topographically selective changes in SWA, the most dra- matic changes in these homeostatic SWA features in aging are observed over the prefrontal cortex regions (Dijk et al., 2010; Munch et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,3,33,Underlying these changes in SWA are impairments in the expression of two unique features of NREM slow waves.
Sleep and Human Aging,3,34,"Both the amplitude as well as the density of slow waves are signifi- cantly reduced in middle-aged adults (Carrier et al., 2011)."

Sleep and Human Aging,4,2,"Age-Related Changes in Homeostatic Sleep Regulation (A) In healthy, young adults, the increasing homeostatic drive to sleep (or “Process S”; green line in schematic graphic) is partially driven by increases in extracellular adenosine building up with accruing time awake (Porkka-Heis- kanen et al., 1997)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,3,"During sleep, adenosine, and consequential sleep pressure, decreases and does so in proportion to the intensity of slow wave activity during sleep (Borbély, 1982)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,4,"In older adults (orange line), the homeostatic buildup of sleep pressure across a day (Process S) is slower and weaker in older adults relative to younger adults."

Sleep and Human Aging,4,8,"Younger adults express larger relative amounts of SWA in all sleep cycles, relative to older adults."

Sleep and Human Aging,4,11,"Relative to younger adults, older adults demon- strated higher levels of adenosine accumulation with increasing time awake."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,12,"However, due to a reduction in adenosine A1 receptors in aging, we hypoth- esize that an adenosine insensitivity develops."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,13,"Therefore, despite higher levels of adenosine in older relative to younger adults, there is potentially a weaker adenosine-associated signaling in the aging brain, resulting in a lower sleep pressure signal in older relative to younger adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,14,"wave amplitude and the decrease in the number of slow waves (density) continues (Dubé et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,15,"Importantly, however, these age-related decreases in slow wave amplitude and density  22 Neuron 94, April 5, 2017  Neuron  are not uniform across the entire topography of the head."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,16,"The largest age-related changes in slow wave amplitude and density occur over the frontal lobe (Figure 1B) (Carrier et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,17,"Moreover, these age-related differences in slow waves are maximal at times when the expression of NREM sleep oscil- lations are maximal, showing the greatest relative impairments during the first 1-2 NREM sleep cycles (Carrier et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,18,"The slope, or steepness, of slow waves also becomes shallower in older adults relative to younger adults (Carrier et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,19,"These morphological changes in waveform shape suggest that aging may diminish the synchronized neuronal en masse firing that gives rise to these sleep oscillations, caused by a disruption in the slow wave depolarized up and/or hyperpolarized down states that shape the slow wave (Beenhakker and Hugue- nard, 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,20,"Parenthetically, the topographic specificity of age-related changes in slow waves can be overlooked by EEG studies that measure activity only at the center of the scalp, as is typical in standard sleep recordings."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,21,"This is relevant, since assessment from only these EEG derivations may therefore contribute to weak effect sizes and apparent failures to replicate age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory associated with age- related cognitive decline (Scullin and Bliwise, 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,22,"Another qualitative change involves the mean frequency of the slow waves, showing a slowing in average frequency of about 0.1 Hz in older relative to younger adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,23,"Unlike density and amplitude, this effect is observed across most EEG derivations of the head (Carrier et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,24,"Interestingly, the exact opposite of this typical slowing in slow wave frequency in cognitively normative older adults is observed in older adults with significant deposition of cortical B-amyloid burden and who also have worse memory retention (Mander et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,25,"This raises the possibility that slow wave frequency represents a potential new, non-invasive sleep biomarker distinguishing normal from abnormal aging in the context of Alzheimer’s disease pathophys- iology (Mander et al., 2016a)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,26,"Expression of the other defining oscillation of NREM sleep, the sleep spindle, also undergoes marked changes in later adult life (Carrier et al., 2011; De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Mander et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,27,"Sleep spindles reflect transient bursts of waxing and waning oscillatory activity in the 12-15 Hz range and are generated through an interaction be- tween corticothalamic networks and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Steriade et al., 1987)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,28,"Spectral power in the frequency range of sleep spindles (e.g., 12-15 Hz) is reduced in middle-aged and older adults, relative to younger adults (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Dijk et al., 1989; Landolt et al., 1996)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,29,"Furthermore, the magnitude of this spindle effect increases across the night, with the largest age-related impairments (up to 50%) being observed in the final sleep cycles of the night, where faster frequency spindles pre- dominate in young adults (Landolt et al., 1996)."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,30,"The age-related reduction in spectral power in the frequency range of sleep spindles (12-15 Hz) is, in part, related to impair- ments in the amount of sleep spindles generated."
Sleep and Human Aging,4,31,"The number, or density per unit time, of sleep spindles declines significantly as adult age advances, with the greatest reductions occurring over frontal EEG derivations (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003;"

Sleep and Human Aging,5,9,"Mander et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,10,"Unique features of the spindle waveform are similarly affected as we grow older, and these too appear to contribute to the overall decrease in signal     power associated with sleep spindles."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,11,"For example, the dura- tion, as well as the peak and mean amplitude of sleep spindles all decrease in older relative to younger adults (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Mander et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,12,"As with slow waves, these changes are topographically specific across the head and temporally specific across the night."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,13,Maximal impairments in spindle density and amplitude occur over frontal lobe regions (Figure 1B).
Sleep and Human Aging,5,14,"In contrast, age-related reductions in spindle duration are maximal over posterior EEG derivations (Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,15,"All three of these age-related disruptions in sleep spindles are most prominent during the last sleep cycles of the night (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Mander et al., 2016b; Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,16,It is important to note that age-related declines in sleep spin- dles can be observed even when the sleep stage from which they arise does not.
Sleep and Human Aging,5,17,"For example, stage 2 NREM sleep duration does not change appreciably with age, yet sleep spindle expres- sion within stage 2 NREM sleep deteriorates significantly in older adults (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Fogel et al., 2016; Mander et al., 2014, 2016b; Martin et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,18,"Furthermore, the charac- teristic reduction in total NREM sleep in older individuals is related to the selective loss of NREM stages 3 and 4, or slow wave sleep, wherein slow waves are principally expressed (Fein- berg and Carlson, 1968)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,19,"Therefore, even when older adults have the same total amount of NREM sleep time, significant differ- ences in the density and amplitude of slow waves within that same sleep-time period can be observed (Carrier et al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,20,"That is, the measure of NREM sleep stage duration alone does not capture all of the information regarding age-related differences in the expression of slow waves."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,21,"More generally, these findings support a model in which age- related changes in gross macro-level sleep architecture (e.g., time and sleep stages) can, and, often are, mechanistically distinct from micro-level changes in physiological sleep oscilla- tions."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,22,"We will return to the relevance of this dissociation below in discussing both the functional consequences of age-related sleep changes, and how this distinction informs the debate of whether or not older adults need less sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,23,"Sleep, Aging, and Gender  Though reliable macro and micro sleep differences exist be- tween younger and older adults, not all older adults suffer the same degree of sleep disruption."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,24,"Instead, there is large inter-in- dividual variability."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,25,This means that age per se is not the sole determinant of sleep disruption in later life.
Sleep and Human Aging,5,26,"Rather, factors that interact with the aging process must confer vulnerability or resil- ience to age-associated declines in sleep quantity and quality."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,27,"In the context of older age, one such interacting factor is gender."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,28,Men experience far greater relative disruption and impairment in NREM sleep than women later in life.
Sleep and Human Aging,5,29,"In a study comparing over 2,500 older adults between the ages of 37 and 92 (Redline et al., 2004), increasing age was reliably associated with the same features described above: decreased slow wave sleep time, reduced sleep efficiency, increased NREM stage 1 sleep time, increased number of arousals, and modest de- creases in REM sleep time."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,30,"However, when stratified by gender, differences emerged (Figure 3A)."
Sleep and Human Aging,5,31,"Men over the age of 70 demon- strated a highly significant 50% reduction in slow wave sleep, relative to men under the age of 55, together with a concomitant  Neuron 94, April 5, 2017 23"
Sleep and Human Aging,6,1,   increase in lighter NREM stages 1 and 2.
Sleep and Human Aging,6,2,"In contrast, women showed no such significant decline in slow wave sleep or in- crease in lighter NREM sleep time relative to their younger gender group."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,3,"Compared between genders, men over the age of 70 had more than a 3-fold deficit in slow wave sleep amount compared with age-matched women."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,4,"Meta-analyses have repli- cated this gender-specific difference in slow wave sleep in older age (Ohayon et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,5,"Interestingly, the moderate reduction in REM sleep time in the oldest participants (>70 years old) was common to both males and females, suggesting a gender-independent deterioration of this sleep stage."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,6,Gender also impacts age-associated changes in slow wave sleep homeostasis.
Sleep and Human Aging,6,7,"Older adult men demonstrate significantly less homeostatic slow wave sleep rebound during recovery sleep following sleep deprivation than equivalent-age older women (Reynolds et al., 1986)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,8,"As with the comparison of basic sleep stages, both elderly men and women show similar homeo- static rebounds in REM sleep during post-deprivation recovery nights (Reynolds et al., 1986)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,9,"Therefore, gender-dependent and gender-independent effects emerge in older age, further suggesting a model in which some homeostatic mechanisms of sleep remain equivalent and somewhat intact in cognitively normal older adult men and women, such as REM sleep, while others show strong gender-dependent differences, such as slow wave sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,10,Precisely when this gender effect on sleep emerges during the adult lifespan remains less clear.
Sleep and Human Aging,6,11,"Young males and females in their 20s often do not to show such dramatic NREM sleep differ- ences, though there is modest evidence of this divergence in those in their mid 30s (Ehlers and Kupfer, 1997; Van Cauter et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,12,"A similarly timed divergence can be seen in the EEG spectral measure of SWA, which is ~50% lower in men in their 30s relative to their 20s, yet 25% in women in their 30s compared with their 20s (Ehlers and Kupfer, 1997)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,13,"If and when gender-dependent changes in distinct features of NREM oscilla- tions, such as the slope of slow waves or the density of sleep spindles, are present in later life remains unexplored, as does the topographical nature of such changes and when they occur across the night."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,14,"Despite gender-specific changes in NREM sleep quantity and quality being more severe in men, a paradoxical and, as yet unexplained, finding is that women are more likely to suffer sub- jective complaints of poor sleep as they get older, relative to older men (Ohayon et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,15,"Whether this is due to report bias on the basis of gender, or is explained by an underlying physiological mechanism, remains unclear."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,16,What Are the Neurobiological Mechanisms of Age- Related Sleep Impairment?
Sleep and Human Aging,6,17,"Neurophysiological and neurochemical changes that encom- pass the brainstem ascending arousal system, thalamus, and hypothalamus, together with select cortical regions, contribute to age-related sleep impairments."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,18,"That large variability in sleep disruption is observed across equivalent age older adults, and the lack of correlation between different sleep features that are impaired in older individuals, indicate that some underlying mechanisms of these changes are independent, while others are interdependent."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,19,"24 Neuron 94, April 5, 2017  Neuron  Though there are a collection of central brain mechanisms that may underlie age-related changes in sleep, other factors also appear to contribute; e.g., presence of sleep disorders, obesity, medication use, nocturnal urinary frequency, chronic pain, hormonal changes, neurodegeneration, psychiatric conditions, and medical comorbidities that are especially prominent with advancing age (Lord et al., 2014; Vitiello, 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,20,"Moreover, processes of abnormal brain aging caused by degenerative neuropathology, such as B-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, are yet another important factor that may be antecedents of these signature sleep disruptions in later life (discussed in Box 1; Mander et al., 2016a)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,21,"Sleep Structure and Stages  Age-related changes in sleep structure and sleep stages have constantly been linked to abnormalities in sleep-wake mainte- nance systems, resulting in instability (Figure 4)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,22,"In young adults, consolidated sleep at night and wakefulness during the day emerges from a balance between brainstem, midbrain, and hy- pothalamic nuclei, which form a bi-stable sleep-wake flip-flop switch (Luppi et al., 2016; Saper et al., 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,23,"A primary promoter of sleep initiation and maintenance involves a small group of cells in the hypothalamic preoptic area, a proportion of which express the inhibitory neuropeptide galanin (Saper et al., 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,24,"The num- ber of galanin-expressing neurons within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus significantly decline with age, and the severity of this cell loss at post-mortem examination predicts the severity of sleep fragmentation in older adults measured in the years prior (Lim et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,25,"In pathological conditions where cell loss is more dramatic, such as Alzheimer’s disease, these relationships become even stronger (Lim et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,26,"Wake-promoting nuclei of the ascending brainstem arousal system and the wake-promoting hypocretin/orexin-expressing neurons within the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)—which collectively help maintain stable wake states (Saper et al., 2010)—also undergo age-related deterioration."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,27,"In rodent models, hypocretin/orexin-expressing neurons are reduced by 40% in older relative to younger adult rats (Kessler et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,28,"In human post-mortem studies, the effect size is smaller though still significant, with a 10% reduction observed in older age (Hunt et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,29,"Larger effects have been observed in patients with tauopathies, indicating that the greater loss of hypocretin/orexin-expressing neurons in such conditions may be partially responsible for the worsening of sleep-wake insta- bility (Kasanuki et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,30,Downstream targets of these wake-promoting systems also contribute to the typical deterioration of stable sleep-wake struc- ture in later life.
Sleep and Human Aging,6,31,"Older adult primates have fewer hypocretin/ orexin-expressing axons that project to the sleep-wake regu- lating target of adrenergic centers in the locus coeruleus (LC) (Downs et al., 2007)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,32,"Further implicating the adrenergic system, older rodents show less of the typical slow wave sleep increase in response to the a-2 adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine than younger rodents and less of the wake-promoting response to the antagonist yohimbine (de Sarro et al., 1988)."
Sleep and Human Aging,6,33,"However, whether these effects are also present in older adult humans is still unknown."

Sleep and Human Aging,7,5,"The sleep promoting preoptic area (POA; blue) sends inhibitory projections to the LHA and the LC and, through this inhibition, helps to initiate and maintain stable sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,6,"The SCN (purple) further modulates this signal across a 24 hr period by fostering higher orexigenic activity in the LHA, promoting wakefulness during the day and decreases in influence permitting sleep at night."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,7,"Due to age-related changes in these nuclei, the strength of sleep and wake promoting signals is compromised, resulting in an unstable brain state (lower right for older adults, relative to upper in younger adults)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,8,(B) Representation of age-related pathological differences in the nuclei that contribute to the flip-flop circuit of sleep-wake regulation.
Sleep and Human Aging,7,9,"Relative to younger adults (green), older adults (orange) show reduced galanin-expressing preoptic area neurons, reduced VIP neurons in the SCN, reduced orexin-ex- pressing neurons in the LHA, and reduced «-2 adrenoreceptor responsivity within the LC."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,10,"These pathological changes may therefore contribute to greater sleep and wake instability in older adults, depicted in (A) bottom right."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,11,(C) Emerging from this proposed instability associated with these age-related changes within brainstem and hypothalamic sleep and wake regulatory centers is a collection of macro-level sleep alterations.
Sleep and Human Aging,7,12,"These include decreased sleep duration, increased sleep latency, increased number of sleep stage transitions toward lighter sleep stages and wake, and greater fragmentation of consolidated periods of sleep and wake in older (orange) relative to younger (green) adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,13,"of note that not all sleep and wake regulatory nuclei are affected, indicating specificity."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,14,"For example, serotonin-expressing neu- rons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (Kidppel et al., 2001) and hista- mine-expressing neurons in the tuberomammilary nucleus of the hypothalamus (ishunina et al., 2003) show minimal age-related changes in human post-mortem examinations and do not pre- dict age-related sleep disruption."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,15,"Beyond sleep-wake regulatory changes, reduced sleep time at night in older human adults is associated with thinning of gray matter within regions in the lateral frontal and superior tem- poral cortices."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,16,"A similar relationship between shorter sleep time and reduced gray matter volume in the lateral prefrontal cortex has been observed in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults (Lim et al., 2016) and further predicts the severity of sleep fragmentation."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,17,Whether or not these associations are a cause or consequence remains less certain.
Sleep and Human Aging,7,18,"Nevertheless, it is clear that selective yet systemic age-related changes in the structure and function of subcortical and cortical brain regions contribute to the deterioration of sleep and wake regulation across the adult lifespan."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,19,"Homeostatic Sleep Drive  The homeostatic pressure to sleep, including slow wave sleep and its associated EEG feature of slow wave activity, is regu- lated, in part, by increasing extracellular adenosine, a metabolic byproduct that accumulates with time spent awake (Dworak et al., 2010; Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,20,"Despite older adults generally having a lower homeostatic sleep response to continued time awake, extracellular adenosine appears to be higher in older relative to younger rodents."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,21,"These age-related differences are particularly prominent in sleep/wake regulating centers of the brainstem and basal forebrain regions (Mackie- wicz et al., 2006; Murillo-Rodriguez et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,22,"This finding would at first appear to contradict the aforementioned lower homeostatic sleep drive commonly observed in human studies of aging, since higher adenosine would predict a higher, not lower, homeostatic drive to sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,23,"One mechanism reconciling this discrepancy is the apparent widespread loss of adenosine A1 receptors that occurs with advancing age (Cheng et al., 2000; Ekonomou et al., 2000; Pago- nopoulou and Angelatou, 1992), present in cortical, thalamic, hippocampal, and striatal regions."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,24,"Significant A1 receptor loss is observed even when controlling for cell loss or overall regional brain volume or weight (Ekonomou et al., 2000; Meyer et al., 2007; Pagonopoulou and Angelatou, 1992) and is accompanied by reduced A1 receptor gene expression (Cheng et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,25,"Therefore, the reduction of A1 receptors may decrease sensi- tivity to the higher extracellular adenosine concentration, despite the increased buildup of adenosine levels reflecting a higher sleep need in older adults (Figure 2C)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,26,"Reduced receptor sensi- tivity would therefore prevent the otherwise greater homeostatic pressure from being translated into a greater homeostatic sleep drive, which would otherwise manifest as an increase in slow wave sleep time and slow wave activity (Figures 2A and 2B)."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,27,"Nevertheless, it is unlikely that changes in adenosine alone fully explain age-related changes in the expression of homeo- static sleep drive."
Sleep and Human Aging,7,28,"Indeed, additional explanatory factors are beginning to emerge and include age-related changes in glial function that may modulate adenosine A1 receptor-dependent  Neuron 94, April5, 2017 25"

Sleep and Human Aging,8,5,"In addition to changes in homeostatic sleep drive, age-related diminution of the arousal promoting circadian signal from the suprachaismatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus may further exacerbate disruptions in stable sleep-wake timing in old adults (Figures 4A and 4B)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,6,"In post-mortem histology analyses, hypo- thalamic SCN neurons have been found to degenerate with advancing age, particularly those expressing vasoactive intesti-  26 Neuron 94, April 5, 2017  Neuron  nal peptide (VIP) (Wang et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,7,"Moreover, the severity of VIP degeneration retrospectively predicts the degree of blunting in the magnitude of the circadian rhythm in motor activity, measured using actigraphy."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,8,"Such a decrease reflects a dimin- ished circadian amplitude that may weaken the evening circa- dian up-swing in the alerting signal present in younger adults (Munch et al., 2005), one that leads to the common feature of older adults having an earlier preference to go to bed."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,9,"Sleep Oscillations  The mechanisms explaining age-related impairments in distinct sleep oscillations are now being revealed, and with them, the potential foundations for future therapeutic intervention."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,10,Struc- tural brain atrophy has consistently been identified as one factor governing age-related impairments in NREM sleep oscillations.
Sleep and Human Aging,8,11,"In young adults, measures of slow wave expression, including amplitude, density, and spectral power of slow waves, are strongly associated with structural gray matter density and volume in select cortical regions in the PFC (Saletin et al., 2013), the same region over which NREM slow waves show maximal expression and within which EEG source generators have been identified (Murphy et al., 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,12,"Atrophy within similar PFC brain regions, measured by both gray matter volume and cortical thickness, predicts the severity of impairment in NREM slow wave features in older adults (Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,13,This associ- ation with gray matter atrophy is especially pronounced in medial and lateral PFC regions (Figure 5).
Sleep and Human Aging,8,14,"While these relationships can be observed when measuring NREM slow wave impairments across a whole night, they are maximal during the first NREM sleep cycle, perhaps unsurprisingly, considering this is the same phase of sleep when SWA is highest (Dubé et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,15,"These results are consistent with the fact that NREM slow wave power and amplitude are maximal over frontal EEG derivations where the biggest increases are also observed following sleep deprivation (Carrier et al., 2011; Landolt and Bor- bély, 2001; Mander et al., 2013; Munch et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,16,"That the EEG source localization of slow waves predominates within midline frontal regions is also consistent with this postulate (Murphy et al., 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,17,"Structural deterioration in other brain regions known to atrophy with age, such as the precuneus, temporal lobe, and hippocampus, do not predict age-related impairments in slow wave activity (Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,18,"This would suggest that age-related changes in NREM sleep oscillations are not simply aconsequence of generalized, non-specific whole-brain atrophy (Mander et al., 2013), but regionally specific cortical atrophy in frontal regions (Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,19,"However, cortical thinning of gray matter in poste- rior brain regions, including the superior parietal cortex, does mediate age-related changes in slow wave amplitude (Dubé et al., 2015), inferring that atrophy within specific regions beyond the PFC can indirectly contribute to age-related disruptions in slow wave expression."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,20,"The decline in the density of slow waves associated with advancing older age is predicted by the loss of gray matter ina network that is partially overlapping with PFC regions predicting SWA and amplitude (Dubé et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,8,21,"Though reduced gray matter in the PFC does predict fewer slow waves in older adults,"
Sleep and Human Aging,9,1,"Neuron  so too do regions beyond, including the insula cortex, regions of the inferior and superior temporal cortex, and a region of the infe- rior parietal cortex (Dubé et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,2,"This was true when assess- ing slow wave density across the entire night or in the first cycles of the night where slow waves are most prominent in younger adults and most deficient in older adults (Carrier et al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015; Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Miinch et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,3,"The fact that atrophy in largely distinct cortical regions is asso- ciated with selectively different age-related changes in slow wave features (density and amplitude) intimates that similarly distinct mechanisms could underlie age-related changes in slow wave generation (e.g., density) and propagation/expression (e.g., amplitude) (Dubé et al., 2015), though these slow wave fea- tures are themselves interdependent."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,4,Deficiencies in sleep spindles—the other dominant oscillation of NREM sleep—in older adults are also associated with struc- tural brain integrity.
Sleep and Human Aging,9,5,"The nature and anatomy of these links are less well understood, though it is distinct from that which pre- dicts changes in slow waves (Figure 5)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,6,"Subcortical reductions in gray matter within the hippocampus predict the degree of reduced number (density) of sleep spindles in older adults, expressly over the frontal lobe (Fogel et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,7,"While sleep spindle generation has classically been considered in the context of thalamo-cortical systems, fMRI studies in young adults have shown reliable associations between sleep spindles and activity within the hippocampus (Andrade et al., 2011; Berg- mann et al., 2012; Schabus et al., 2007)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,8,"Moreover, sleep spindles are functionally linked to the temporal burst firing of sharp-wave ripple events in the hippocampus in young and middle-aged adults, further implicating this region in spindle regulation (Fell et al., 2001)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,9,"Therefore, age-related atrophy of cell bodies within the hippocampus is fitting with impairments in the functional expression of sleep spindles."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,10,"Though oscillations, including sleep oscillations, are gener- ated by neuronal cell bodies, their network propagation, or trans- mission, depends on the integrity of white matter fiber tracts."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,11,"In young adult humans and rodents, white matter integrity in fiber tracts that form cortico-thalamic loops is associated with the quantitative and qualitative expression of sleep spindles (Pian- toni et al., 2013; Steriade et al., 1987)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,12,"In agreement with these findings, preliminary human data indicate that age-related dete- rioration in white matter integrity within the body and splenium of the corpus callosum predicts the severity of impaired sleep spindle expression in older adults (Mander et al., 2016b)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,13,"These effects remain significant when controlling for age, reemphasiz- ing the notion that processes associated with aging, but not an individual's age, per se, are the more significant determinant of these links between brain deterioration and sleep deterioration."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,14,Gender Differences in Sleep The biological causes of gender-dependent differences in sleep impairment—men suffering worse NREM sleep deterioration than women—are somewhat less well characterized.
Sleep and Human Aging,9,15,"However, four lines of evidence provide a set of tenable, non-mutually exclusive, explanatory candidates."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,16,"First, gender-specific changes in the circadian alerting signal may account for greater sleep fragmentation, less consolidated sleep, and higher daytime nap propensity in older men."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,17,"Human post-mortem histopathology evidence has demonstrated far     larger relative losses in the number of VIP-expressing neurons in the SCN in men relative to women across the lifespan (Zhou et al., 1995)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,18,"Such findings are consistent with loss of VIP-ex- pressing neurons in the SCN of aged rodents, a reduction that correlates with age-associated sleep and circadian disturbances (Figure 4) (Chee et al., 1988)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,19,"These findings support the human post-mortem study linking loss of VIP-expressing neurons within the SCN to a blunting of the circadian rhythm of motor activity in older adults (Wang et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,20,"Nevertheless, that age-related changes in the integrity of VIP-expressing neurons causally contributes to sex differences in sleep timing, organization, and/or consolidation in humans remains unproven at present."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,21,"Second, the preoptic region of the hypothalamus, which powerfully regulates NREM sleep pressure and thus amount, is sexually dimorphic."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,22,"In young adults, males have greater numbers of galanin-expressing neurons within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus than women (Swaab and Fliers, 1985)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,23,"However, human post-mortem histopathology studies have demonstrated that by late life, this gender difference was diminished, indicating a more rapid relative decline in galanin- expressing neurons in this preoptic hypothalamic region in males than females."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,24,"This may explain the more severe relative impair- ment in slow wave sleep duration and quality in males than fe- males with advancing age (Garcia-Falgueras et al., 2011; Redline et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,25,"A similar male-specific decline in hypocretin/orexin- expressing neurons in the hypothalamus has also been observed in older adult rodents (Brownell and Conti, 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,26,"As these neurons are critical for maintaining stable sleep and wake states (Saper et al., 2010), such gender-specific changes may further contribute to male-selective declines in NREM sleep."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,27,"Third are structural changes within the LC, a region that plays a key role in slow wave sleep homeostasis (Cirelli et al., 2005)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,28,"In vivo MRI measures have identified age-related declines in neuromelanin-sensitive cells in the LC, and this reduction in the LC cell mass is greater in older males than older females (Cle- wett et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,29,"This gender-dependent age-related decline in noradrenergic brainstem signals has the potential to weaken slow wave sleep homeostasis, causing more dramatic NREM sleep disruption in older males relative to females."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,30,"Fourth, older adult men experience more accelerated gray matter atrophy in the core NREM slow wave generating region of the medial prefrontal cortex (Kakimoto et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2009), which is the same cortical region in which atrophy predicts the severity of SWA decline in the elderly in general (Figure 5) (Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,31,"Moreover, older adult males suffer greater reductions in metabolic activity in the medial prefrontal regions similar to the medial prefrontal SWA-source generating regions, implicating a functional impairment that may even precede the greater medial prefrontal gray matter atrophy observed in men (Kakimoto et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,32,"Indepen- dently or collectively, these regionally and functionally specific possibilities all lead to falsifiable predictions regarding the mechanisms of gender differences in sleep deterioration in later life."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,33,"There is currently no consensus mechanism explaining these age-related sex differences in the deterioration of sleep/wake regulatory brain centers, though candidate intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are emerging."
Sleep and Human Aging,9,34,"For example, age-related decreases in  Neuron 94, April5, 2017 27"
Sleep and Human Aging,10,1,"   the expression of growth hormone and testosterone have been tied to the deterioration of consolidated sleep, reductions in the amount and intensity of slow wave sleep, and decreases in the number of galanin-expressing neurons within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus in humans (Garcia-Falgueras et al., 2011; Latta et al., 2005; Van Cauter et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,2,"Supporting an effect of sex, older males not only show a greater decline in slow wave sleep, relative to females, but in men this reduction correlates with decreased growth hormone secretion that begins in midlife (Van Cauter et al., 2000), while no such relationship is observed in older women (Latta et al., 2005)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,3,Another intrinsic hormonal candidate is testosterone.
Sleep and Human Aging,10,4,"The pul- satile secretion of testosterone increases with transitions into slow wave sleep in young men (Veldhuis et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,5,"This asso- ciation, and testosterone levels in general, decreases with age, and low testosterone levels in older men is associated with decreased sleep efficiency and greater sleep fragmentation (Barrett-Connor et al., 2008; Harman et al., 2001; Veldhuis et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,6,"Testosterone has been proposed to underlie the sex differences in atrophy associated with galanin-expressing neurons within the preoptic hypothalamic area (Garcia-Falgue- ras et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,7,"In rodent studies, galanin neuronal density is reduced by castration and restored with testosterone treatment (Park et al., 1997)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,8,"In human studies, both castrated men and male to female transsexual individuals have galanin-expressing neurons within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus reduced to anumber similar to that observed in women (Garcia-Falgueras et al., 2011)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,9,Extrinsic influences include lifestyle factors and behavioral choices.
Sleep and Human Aging,10,10,"One such example is alcohol intake, which was higher in men than women in the study of gender differences in age- related cortical atrophy and hypometabolism (Kakimoto et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,11,"Alcohol has marked effects on the quantity and quality of sleep (Thakkar et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,12,"Indirect effects of alcohol are also possible: greater alcohol intake is associated with greater medial prefrontal atrophy (Rando et al., 2011), and the integrity and functionality of the medial prefrontal cortex is critical for NREM slow wave generation (Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2013; Murphy et al., 2009; Varga et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,13,"Nevertheless, all these proposed mechanisms remain speculative."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,14,Are There Functional Consequences of Age-Related Sleep Impairment?
Sleep and Human Aging,10,15,Age-related sleep disruption is not epiphenomenal.
Sleep and Human Aging,10,16,"Rather, these alterations have significant downstream consequences for brain and body health."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,17,"This is perhaps not surprising considering that sleep in young adults supports every major physiological system within the body, including immune, meta- bolic, thermoregulatory, endocrine, and cardiovascular function (Irwin, 2015); and numerous cognitive and affective neural processes, such as learning and memory, emotional regulation, attention, motivation, decision making, and motor control (Walker, 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,18,"While it is outside the scope of the current review to describe all links between sleep impairment and this diverse array of brain and body dysfunction in the elderly, as an exem- plar, we devote the next section to reviewing the evidence linking age-related changes in sleep to impairments in learning and memory processing in older adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,19,"28 Neuron 94, April 5, 2017  Neuron  Sleep before and after learning plays a causal role in memory processing (Walker, 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,20,"NREM sleep quantity and oscillatory quality prior to learning support the restoration of next-day hip- pocampal-dependent encoding capacity and thus initial learning (Antonenko et al., 2013; Mander et al., 2014; Van Der Werf et al., 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,21,"Features of NREM sleep after encoding, including (but not limited to) NREM slow waves, have consistently been linked to the subsequent offline consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory processing."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,22,"In doing so, sleep after learning stabilizes new memory representations, thereby minimizing long-term forgetting (Diekelmann and Born, 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,23,These same processes have since been characterized in older adults and shown to be interacting and deficient.
Sleep and Human Aging,10,24,"Sleep, Aging, and Initial Memory Encoding  A common feature of age-related cognitive decline is an impaired ability to form new hippocampal-dependent memories, such as new facts or new person-name associations (Miller et al., 2008; Sperling et al., 2003)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,25,"A meta-analysis of studies of self-reported measures of sleep in older adults has estab- lished an association between poor and shorter sleep and the extent of impairment on numerous cognitive tests, including several requiring verbal memory encoding (Lo et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,26,"Objective, rather than subjective, measures of sleep in older adults support these associations."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,27,"The degree of actigraphy- measured sleep disturbance in older adults predicts increasingly worse scores on standardized neuropsychological tests, including memory subcomponents that depend upon the hippo- campus."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,28,"Moreover, these associations remain significant when controlling for cardiovascular conditions, history of medication use, indices of depression, anxiety, and stress (Cavuoto et al., 2016), suggesting sleep-specific associations with impaired memory encoding, beyond age-related cofactors."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,29,Qualitative sleep EEG changes in aging have provided more detailed mechanistic explanations of impaired sleep-dependent memory encoding in the elderly.
Sleep and Human Aging,10,30,"In young adults, the density of NREM fast-frequency sleep spindles over PFC derivations— the same region over which reductions in fast sleep spindles are most dramatic in older adults (Mander et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013)—predicts the restoration of hippocampal encoding activity and episodic learning capacity in younger adults (Mander et al., 2011, 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,31,"In older adults, the magnitude of impairment in fast-frequency spindle density significantly predicts the failure to which the hippocampus will engage in episodic associative memory encoding the following day, which, in turn, mediates the success of learning ability (Mander et al., 2014) (Figure 6A)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,32,"Interestingly, this triadic relationship (impaired fast sleep spindles, decreased hippocampal encoding activity, and impaired learning) was independent of the gross structural prop- erties of the hippocampus, suggesting a sleep-functional, rather than atrophy-structural, association with the inability to effec- tively form new memories in the elderly (Mander et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,33,"Such evidence does not, however, negate the possibility that structural alterations within the hippocampus in older adults are a consequence of associated sleep impairment, nor that other non-mutually exclusive consequences to the hippocam- pus contribute to memory encoding deficits."
Sleep and Human Aging,10,34,"For example, ro- dent models have established that sleep deprivation suppresses adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Guzman-Marin et al., 2007)."

Sleep and Human Aging,11,2,"Hippocampus-Dependent Memory Decline Is Associated with Age-Related Sleep Disruption  (A) Sleep, including NREM fast sleep spindles, before learning supports the initial act of memory encoding (e.g., learning a face-name association) through a mediating influence on learning-dependent hippocampal activity."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,3,"Age-related disruption of fast-frequency NREM sleep spindles over the prefrontal cortex at- tenuates this hippocampal encoding activity and thus the sleep-dependent learning restoration benefit (adapted from Mander et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,4,"(B) Sleep, specifically NREM slow waves, after learning supports the subsequent offline consolidation of new memories, promoting hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation, resulting in hippocampal-independent retrieval the next day, minimizing overnight forgetting."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,5,"Age-related impairment in NREM slow wave activity in the prefrontal cortex predicts worse overnight hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation, resulting in persistent, rather than progressively hippocampal-independent next-day retrieval activity."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,6,"This is associated with accelerated forgetting and thus worse long-term memory retention (adapted from  Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,7,"Nevertheless, how such a relationship relates to the recognized reduction in the structural integrity of the human hippocampus in aging remains unexplored."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,8,"Functionally, chronic sleep restriction in rats, which is more representative of age-related sleep impairment than acute total sleep deprivation, adds to age-related calcium signaling impair- ments within the hippocampus of older animals (de Souza et al., 2012)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,9,This represents another viable route through which im- pairments in hippocampal-dependent learning can be affected by sleep impairments in later life.
Sleep and Human Aging,11,10,"Additionally, increasing levels of adenosine within the hippocampus in middle-aged rats, presumably associated with deficient sleep and consequent increased time awake (Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997), predicts impairment in long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons (Rex et al., 2005)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,11,"Moreover, age-related memory deficits in rats, which may be associated with age-related sleep deteriora- tion, can be reversed with caffeine or adenosine (Aga) receptor antagonists (Prediger et al., 2004; Rex et al., 2005)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,12,"Therefore, intra-hippocampal structural and functional changes associated with aging suggest numerous pathways through which the canonical sleep disruption of later life can impair hippocampal- dependent learning ability and contribute to cognitive decline."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,13,That NREM sleep offers a causal contribution to deficits in the formation of new hippocampal-based memories in later adult life has also been established.
Sleep and Human Aging,11,14,"Experimentally applied acoustic-tone disruption of deep NREM sleep in older adults, during which slow waves coupled with sleep spindles predominate, significantly decreases next-day hippocampal encoding activity and associ- ated learning, despite sleep duration and efficiency remaining intact (Van Der Werf et al., 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,15,"Additionally, enhancing the in-  tensity of the slow oscillation in young adults using transcranial direct current stimulation causally renews post-sleep hippocam- pal-dependent learning ability (Antonenko et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,16,"Such findings are of importance practically and clinically considering that older adults are often prescribed medications for sleep-un- related conditions (e.g., hypertension) that can themselves disrupt NREM sleep (Novak and Shapiro, 1997) and thus negate a functional sleep-dependent memory benefit."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,17,"Sleep, Aging, and Memory Consolidation  Sleep after initial encoding supports the subsequent long-term consolidation of recent hippocampal-dependent memory repre- sentations."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,18,"This benefit involves a coupled dynamic between three NREM oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (<1 Hz), sleep spindles, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Staresina et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,19,"It is through this coordination of oscillations that the long-term reorganization of memory representations is hypothesized to be achieved, transforming memories from a hippocampal- to a more cortical-dependent form, aiding in memory stabilization and averting interference from ongoing encoding within the hippocampus (Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Walker, 2009)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,20,"Across multiple levels of analysis, growing evidence suggests that sleep disruption mediates the effects of age-related long- term memory impairment for which consolidation is key."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,21,"Self-re- ported sleep quality the night after word-list learning in older adults is associated with memory retention 1 week later, with number of awakenings predicting progressively worse remem- bering (Mary et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,11,22,"While reductions in objective measures of slow wave sleep time in middle-aged (age 48-55) adults predicts worse offline consolidation and thus memory retention  Neuron 94, April 5, 2017 29"
Sleep and Human Aging,12,1,"   (Backhaus et al., 2007), the same relationship between this same gross measure of slow wave sleep does not reliably predict long- term memory retention in older adults (Scullin, 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,2,"A similar lack of prediction between the amount of time spent in slow wave sleep and post-sleep memory retention has been observed in older adults following a nap (Baran et al., 2016), demonstrating that the lack of such an association in older adults cannot simply be explained by time-of-day circadian recall factors."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,3,"Neverthe- less, slow wave sleep in older adults does predict post-sleep memory accuracy in the context of a reduction in false memories using a word learning paradigm (Lo et al., 2014), which may indi- cate a qualitative, more than quantitative, association between the global measure of slow wave sleep time and memory in older adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,4,Other differences also appear to contribute to this heterogene- ity of relationships with basic sleep stages.
Sleep and Human Aging,12,5,"Offline consolidation of a hippocampus-dependent visuospatial memory task corre- lates with the severity of impairment in REM sleep time in elderly individuals, rather than the classic NREM sleep stage associa- tion in younger adults; though this effect is only observed in older adults who initially encoded the task effectively before the consolidation phase (Sonni and Spencer, 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,6,"This finding first suggests a connection between sleep stages and hippocampal- dependent memory consolidation in older adults that may encompass both NREM and REM (the latter, potentially in a compensatory manner), relative to younger adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,7,"Second, these findings emphasize the careful need to train older adults to some degree of initial encoding competence prior to sleep, since the variability of initial learning of hippocampal- dependent memory representations may cause variability in whether or not offline sleep-dependent consolidation can be accomplished."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,8,"Robust and consistent relationships between sleep and mem- ory consolidation are, however, observed when assessing the more detailed measure of physiological sleep oscillations, and these associations are topographically specific."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,9,"The degree of impaired SWA across older adults predicts worse overnight memory consolidation, resulting in greater next-day forgetting (Figure 6B) (Mander et al., 2013; Varga et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,10,"Though this association was observed globally across all electrode channels averaged, frontal electrodes showed the strongest relationship between SWA and overnight memory consolidation (Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,11,"This is consistent with the age-dependent sensitivity of this region to declining SWA in older adults (Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,12,"Identification of this SWA association in older adults appears to require assessing a full night of sleep, potentially because of the full homeostatic expression of SWA, since similar relationships do not reach significance when assessed using a daytime nap (Baran et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,13,"More than being associated with the end-outcome of failed long-term memory retention, age-related impairments in overnight NREM sleep oscillatory activity further predict an impoverished degree of neural transformation of hippocampal- neocortical transformation of episodic memory representations."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,14,"Age-related deficits of SWA over PFC are associated with the continued next-day reliance of memory retrieval on hippocampal activity (Mander et al., 2013), rather than the adaptive develop- ment of increasing hippocampal-independent retrieval that is  30 Neuron 94, April 5, 2017  Neuron  observed in young healthy adults (Takashima et al., 2006)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,15,"More- over, these age-related SWA impairments further diminish the development of hippocampal-prefrontal functional connec- tivity that is otherwise stronger during post-sleep retrieval in young adults, another proxy associated with hippocampal- neocortical memory consolidation (Baran et al., 2016; Mander et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,16,"Beyond encoding and consolidation, what remains to be es- tablished is the impact of age-related sleep impairment upon the final act of memory retrieval, years or even decades later."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,17,"Recent evidence in young adults has demonstrated that sleep prior to attempted recall of memories predicts probability of successful retrieval (Dumay, 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,18,"That is, sleep also facilitates accessibility to potentially available memories."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,19,"Whether or not sleep impairments in older adults contribute to canonical fail- ures of memory recall in older adults is unknown (Burke and Light, 1981; Craik, 1977)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,20,"Finally, though beyond the scope of our focus on hippocampal-dependent memory processing, age-related sleep impairments also compromise certain as- pects of procedural skill memory, the underlying neurobiolog- ical mechanisms of which remain unclear (e.g., Backhaus et al., 2015; Fogel et al., 2013; King et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2008; Spencer et al., 2007; Tucker et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2012)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,21,"Sleep Restoration, Aging, and Memory  The vast majority of studies reporting an association between sleep, aging, and memory are correlational in nature."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,22,"However, several studies have sought to enhance the sleep of older adults, and with it, memory."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,23,These studies are informative in at least two ways.
Sleep and Human Aging,12,24,"First, they establish a causal contribution of sleep to memory in the elderly, as has been shown in young adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,25,"Second, therapeutic interventions that restore sleep may deliver preventative benefits that reduce the risk and/or severity of cognitive decline in aging, or mechanisms and/or processes that lead to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease (Mander et al., 2016a), or body ill-health consequences, such as hypertension or chronic pain (Neikrug and Ancoli-lsrael, 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,26,"However, it is important to note that these methods have not been investigated using longitudinal study designs, and thus the longitudinal utility of such methods remains unknown."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,27,"In young adults, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the <1 Hz slow oscillation frequency range during slow wave sleep increases slow oscillation power and almost doubles overnight memory retention (Marshall et al., 2006)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,28,"In older adults, multiple studies have shown that enhancing the slow oscillation using tDCS during an afternoon nap leads to a mem- ory enhancement; one showing heightened SWA in the slow oscillation frequency range (<1 Hz) and word-pair performance (Westerberg et al., 2015), and another showing enhanced slow oscillation and fast sleep spindle EEG power that led to a benefit in a visual memory task (Ladenbauer et al., 2016)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,29,"Auditory closed-loop stimulation during slow wave sleep has also been shown to enhance slow oscillation power and associated hippo- campus-dependent memory consolidation in young adults (Ngo et al., 2013)."
Sleep and Human Aging,12,30,Preliminary findings in older adults have reported increased slow oscillation power during blocks of auditory stim- ulation that is associated with enhanced next-day declarative
Sleep and Human Aging,13,1,"Neuron  memory recall (Papalambros et al., 2017)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,2,"It is of note, however, that some studies implementing varied forms of brain stimulation have failed to replicate the beneficial enhancement of sleep physiology and/or memory consolidation (Eggert et al., 2013; Passmann et al., 2016; Sahlem et al., 2015)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,3,"Therefore, brain stimulation methods offer potential promise as intervention tools in the context of aging, but they require further refinement and demonstration of efficacy and reproducibility before being real- istic options at present."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,4,"Pharmacological methods using classic GABA-targeting hyp- notics for selective NREM sleep enhancement have so far proved less promising in the context of aging and often fail to trigger any corresponding sleep-dependent memory benefit in the elderly, sometimes even causing amnestic effects (Feld et al., 2013; Hall-Porter et al., 2014; Mednick et al., 2013; Vienne et al., 2012)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,5,Little is currently known regarding the impact of more contemporary non-GABA-targeting sleep medications on enhancing sleep and/or cognition in the elderly populations at risk for dementia.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,6,"Overall, several novel, non-pharmacological approaches are emerging that may represent candidate methods for sleep resto- ration in the elderly and, with such restoration, improvements in those mental and physical functions that rely on sleep and are causally deficient in the elderly as a result."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,7,Do Older Adults Need Less Sleep?
Sleep and Human Aging,13,8,It is clear that sleep changes markedly as we transition into old age.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,9,"However, a fundamental question remains debated: do older adults get less sleep simply because they need less sleep, or do older adults need more sleep than they get, being inca- pable of generating that which they still need?"
Sleep and Human Aging,13,10,We close this re- view by briefly exploring the arguments that favor and do not favor the claim that older adults need less sleep.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,11,In Favor  Three core observations support the hypothesis that older adults do not require as much sleep as younger adults and therefore do not have a significant unmet sleep need.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,12,"First, older adults sleep significantly less than younger adults when offered extremely long, enforced periods of sleep opportunity (time in bed >12 hr/day) (Klerman and Dijk, 2008)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,13,This has been consid- ered to reflect an ad-lib sleep need that is lower in older relative to younger adults.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,14,"Second, following sleep-deprivation or experimental slow wave sleep suppression, healthy older adults exhibit a smaller rebound in slow wave sleep time and SWA compared to younger adults (Dijk et al., 2010; Munch et al., 2004)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,15,This suggests a lower buildup of homeostatic sleep pressure in older relative to younger adults.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,16,"Third, and related, older adults suffer less subjective and objective waking sleepi- ness following selective slow wave sleep deprivation than do younger adults; a result that even holds true under rested conditions (Dijk et al., 2010)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,17,"Furthermore, older adults suffer less relative impairment on sleep-sensitive vigilance tasks under sleep deprivation conditions, relative to younger adults (Adam et al., 2006)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,18,"These findings collectively suggest that older adults demonstrate many of the phenotypic signs of a reduced homeostatic sleep drive, indicative of a reduced sleep need (Dijk et al., 2010; Klerman and Dijk, 2008)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,19,"That is, sleep need decreases with age."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,20,Not in Favor Four sets of findings support the alternative hypothesis: older adults need more sleep than they are normally able to obtain.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,21,"First, evidence does not favor the interpretation of a lower ho- meostatic sleep drive in older adults, but rather, impaired sensi- tivity to a still present homeostatic drive."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,22,"Extracellular adenosine levels, which are a major molecular marker of homeostatic sleep drive (Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997), actually increases with advancing adult age in many sleep regulatory centers (Mackie- wicz et al., 2006)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,23,A lower homeostatic sleep drive would predict the opposite.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,24,"This discrepancy appears to be due to a wide- spread loss of A1 adenosine receptors in the aged brain (Meyer et al., 2007)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,25,"Compounding this adenosine receptor downregula- tion, neuronal loss in sleep regulatory centers that are influenced by this system and involved in sleep homeostasis may further impair the regulation of sleep drive (Lim et al., 2014)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,26,"Thus, instead of reduced sleep need, aging could alternatively be characterized as a desensitization to a still present homeostatic sleep drive and a reduction in the neural apparatus for regulating a still present sleep need."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,27,"Second, while healthy older adults report being less subjectively sleepy, such measures are confounded by prior sleep history."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,28,"The rise in the subjective sleepiness in the first days of chronic sleep restriction in young adults will often re- normalize back to lower sleepiness in later deprivation days, despite objective performance continuing to decline (Van Don- gen et al., 2003)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,29,"Therefore, reports of less subjective sleepiness in older adults may not provide reliable indicators of a well-slept or even acutely sleep-deprived brain, because older adults may be suffering from the same renormalizing effect of chronic sleep restriction."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,30,"Third, although older adults show smaller relative impairments in objective performance on vigilance tasks when placed under conditions of sleep deprivation than younger adults (Adam et al., 2006), this too can be an artifact of baseline."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,31,"Older adults often perform significantly worse than younger adults under well rested conditions to begin with (Harrison et al., 2000; Philip et al., 2004; Webb, 1985; Webb and Levy, 1982), so much so that some studies have indicated that rested older adults show levels of cognitive impairment similar to that of sleep-deprived younger adults (Chee and Choo, 2004; Harrison et al., 2000)."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,32,"Thus, older adults may already be impaired at baseline in numerous cogni- tive domains and, as a result, may not have much further to fall in terms of performance impairment when placed under conditions of sleep deprivation, while younger adults do."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,33,This floor effect in the elderly may complicate any interpretation of differences in sleep need between younger relative to older adults.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,34,"Fourth, older adults do, however, demonstrate significantly worse performance on other sleep-dependent cognitive func- tions, such as learning and long-term memory consolidation."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,35,This is not simply because they are older.
Sleep and Human Aging,13,36,"Rather, sleep-depen- dent learning and memory impairments in older adults remain when statistically accounted for age, instead being explained by the degree of impairment in NREM sleep oscillations."
Sleep and Human Aging,13,37,"Thus, the deterioration in sleep quantity and quality in older relative to younger adults has cognitive consequences; consequences that would suggest that older adults are not capable of generating  Neuron 94, April5, 2017 31"
Sleep and Human Aging,14,1,   the quality of sleep that they still appear to need to optimally main- tain specific cognitive functions.
Sleep and Human Aging,14,2,"Together, these findings argue against the suggestion that sleep need is reduced in older adults."
Sleep and Human Aging,14,3,"That is, sleep need remains, but sleep regulating and/or gener- ating capacity declines."
Sleep and Human Aging,14,4,"It is important to note that this does not mean older adults need more sleep time, per se, but rather that sleep quality, and the associated capacity to express consoli- dated NREM sleep rich in sleep oscillations, may be deficient."
Sleep and Human Aging,14,5,"In conclusion, some evidence indicates that sleep need is reduced in older adults, including that older adults innately get less sleep, show less intense rebound sleep following depriva- tion, report less subjective sleepiness under sleep restriction conditions, and suffer a smaller increase in lapses of attention after sleep deprivation and restriction."
Sleep and Human Aging,14,6,"However, alternative ex- planations of these findings leave open the possibility that sleep need remains high while sleep-generating capacity is impaired, for which there is now significant supportive empirical data."
Sleep and Human Aging,14,7,"While there remains no complete consensus surrounding this debate, the current evidence appears to most parsimoniously support the hypothesis that older adults do not have a reduced sleep need, but rather, an impaired ability to register and/or generate that unmet sleep need."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,2,"Additionally, a growing number of studies have suggested that dream experience might be considered an expression of human wellbeing (Frankl et al., 2021; Scarpelli et al., 2022) and has a pivotal role in emotional regulation, as suggested by some neurobiological findings (Nielsen & Lara-Carrasco, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,3,"For instance, dream recall and night- mare frequency increase when subjects are exposed to adverse and trau- matic events (e.g., Hartmann & Brezler, 2008; Nielsen et al., 2006; Sandman et al., 2013; Tempesta et al., 2013)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,4,"Also, the qualitative charac- teristics of dream reports change in parallel with the emotional charge of waking experiences (Schredl, 2006; Scarpelli et al., 2021)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,5,"It should be highlighted that psychoanalysis had primacy in dream research until the discovery of the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1953)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,6,"The interpretation of oneiric con- tents was one of the main focusses of the Freudian theories positing that dreaming allows access to the unconscious functions of the mind in neurosis treatment (Freud, 1953)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,7,Aserinsky and Kleitman (1953) observed specific intervals with rapid and recurrent eye movement and bursts of alpha activity comparable to those that occur during wakefulness.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,8,"The enthusiasm linked to the discovery of REM sleep considerably influenced dreaming research in several ways, and the neuroscientific study of dreaming is relatively recent."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,9,"Several studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experi- ence through a neuropsychological approach (Solms, 1997, 2000), neuroimaging (Maquet et al., 1996) and electrophysiological tech- niques (Marzano et al., 2011; Siclari et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,10,"Although several studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of specific brain mechanisms predicting dream recall (e.g., Siclari et al., 2017), many questions are still at the centre of the debate."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,11,The present paper summarises the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dream experience.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,12,"Specifically, the review offers an overview about (a) the question related to the REM-non- REM (NREM) sleep dichotomy, (b) the state-trait-like problem, (c) the relationship between waking and dreaming state and the manipulation of dreaming, (d) the issue concerning the access to dream experience, (e) the role of nightmares, and (f) the debate on dreamwork in  psychotherapy."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,13,1.1.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,14,"| The REM-NREM sleep dichotomy  Acclassical view of the neurobiological basis of the oneiric activity pos- tulates the existence of a close relationship between dream experi- ence and REM sleep (Hobson et al., 2000; Nielsen, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,15,"This hypothesis was based on early electroencephalographic (EEG) obser- vations showing that >70% of individuals awakened during REM sleep reported dreams, while dream recall at the awakening from other sleep stages was rare (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1955)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,16,"According to this view, the wake-like high-frequency EEG pattern characterising REM sleep would represent the ideal electrophysiological scenario for the occurrence of dream experiences, while the slow-frequency activity characterising NREM sleep would be associated with the absence of  oneiric activity."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,17,"However, using different criteria to collect dream  reports, several studies found that successful recall of a conscious experience can be frequently observed also after NREM awakenings, and in a minority of cases no dream experience was reported after REM awakenings (Foulkes, 1962; Nielsen, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,18,"Moreover, dream recall is still possible after lesions in brain regions involved in REM sleep generation, while the total disappearance of dream recall can be observed after focal forebrain lesions without an impact on REM sleep (Solms, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,19,"Also, dream experience is preserved after pharmacolog- ical suppression of REM sleep (Landolt et al., 2001; Oudiette et al., 2012)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,20,"Finally, dream recall has been recently associated with a similar electrophysiological response after REM and NREM sleep (D'Atri et al., 2019; Siclari et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,21,"These results suggest that (a) dream and REM sleep are controlled by distinct brain mechanisms, (b) the postulate of a clear distinction between presence and absence of dreaming respectively in REM and NREM has not a solid support, and therefore (c) dreams can occur in any sleep stage."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,5,"On the one hand, this disturbance is frequently related to post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Germain, 2013), but it could also be a reaction to stress conditions (Scarpelli et al., 2022)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,6,"On the other hand, also idiopathic nightmares, i.e., without a known cause, should be con- sidered."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,7,"For instance, this kind of mental sleep activity is quite com- mon in children tending to disappear during adulthood, and it is more frequent among females (Nielsen & Levin, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,8,"From a neurobiological perspective, a recent investigation shows that the activation of the autonomic nervous system may be linked to nightmares (Paul et al., 2019)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,9,"Some studies revealed REM-specific alterations in nightmare sufferers such as longer REM latency, increased skipping of early REM periods and cycle length, and more frequent REM periods (Nielsen et al., 2010)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,10,"Furthermore, some EEG findings highlighted the presence of slow frontal and central theta activity during REM sleep in a group of nightmare recallers (Marquis et al, 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,11,"Further studies reported evidence for reduced slow- wave sleep and greater intra-sleep wakefulness (Simor et al., 2012), increased alpha power during REM sleep, and higher levels of EEG desynchronisation in NREM sleep of students with frequent night- mares (Simor et al., 2013)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,12,"In other words, as already mentioned for dream recall, a higher autonomic and electrophysiological activation may provide the physiological background to the nightmare occur- rence (Fisher et al., 1970; Nielsen & Zadra, 2005)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,13,This is consistent with the self-reported experience of greater emotional and physical activations during the nightmare occurrence.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,14,"Fear is the predominant emotion included in nightmares (Zadra et al., 2006), suggesting that nightmares could be linked to fear- dysfunction disturbances, i.e., phobias, generalised or social anxiety (Nielsen & Levin, 2007; Walker, 2010)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,15,"In other words, nightmares could be related to the dysfunction in the hippocampal-amygdala pre- frontal system that controls fear memory formation and extinction (Marquis et al., 2017; Nielsen & Levin, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,16,"Nevertheless, the func- tional role of nightmares is still debated."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,17,"Considering the early theo- ries of dream function emphasising roles for REM sleep and dreaming in promoting adaptation to stress, nightmares could be interpreted as a failure of this process (Wright & Koulack, 1987)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,18,"Along this vein, some authors proposed that a certain degree of awareness of our dream contents and the possibility of altering them may be beneficial for nightmares sufferers (Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001; Neidhardt et al., 1992)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,19,"In particular, compelling evidence highlighted that imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is very effective in reducing chronic nightmares within 6-12 weeks of ther- apy (Germain et al., 2004; Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001;  Neidhardt et al., 1992)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,20,"This technique consists of modifying the plot of the recurring nightmare during the wakefulness by an imaginal rehearsal of a new dream without disturbing items (Kellner et al., 1992)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,21,"The nightmare sufferers learn to change the nightmares scenes by creating a less unpleasant ending and including mastery ele- ments in the new dream scenario (Germain et al., 2004)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,22,"Interestingly, lucid dreaming induction could represent a useful intervention to reduce nightmares (Zadra & Pihl, 1997; Spoormaker & Van Den Bout, 2006; Rak et al., 2015)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,23,"It has been hypothesised that lucid dreaming could be a sort of coping strategy to face unpleasant stimuli during a dream experience (Schiappa et al., 2018)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,24,"Actually, lucid dream therapy is a cognitive technique that allows patients to learn to be aware of and modify their mental sleep activity during their nightmares through daily exercises (Spoormaker & Van Den Bout, 2006; Zadra & Pihl, 1997)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,25,"More recently, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro, 1989) has been employed for nightmares treatment in PTSD."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,26,"Starting from the view that nightmares are the manifesta- tions of adverse events registered in a dysfunctional form, this tech- nique aimed to promote the recall of distressing images while activating one type of bilateral sensory input (e.g., hand tapping or side-to-side eye movement)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,27,The protocol allows subjects to identify and reprocess the targeted disturbing memories and experiences in order to formulate insight and adaptive behaviour.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,28,"In conclusion, it should be underlined that studies on PSG abnor- malities and specific macro- and micro-structural features correlated to nightmares are still missing."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,29,"Further, efficacy studies on nightmare treatment (i.e., IRT, lucid dream therapy, EMDR) are scarce and frag- mentary."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,30,Future research should be conducted to fill this gap and explore the effectiveness of the above-mentioned interventions for  nightmare disorders.

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,32,"An interesting open issue concerns the possible usefulness of the oneiric experience as a tool in clinical practice, also in light of the neu- roscientific knowledge on dreams."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,33,"Classically, Freud (1953) proposed two main functions of dreams: the expression of repressed infantile wishes and the protection of sleep."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,34,"The antimoral nature of such wishes implies the need of a dis- tortion through the dream censor to be acceptable, allowing their par- tial expression while protecting the continuity of sleep."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,35,"Freud distinguished the manifest and the latent content of dream, the latter containing the true meaning of the dream."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,36,"Free associations would represent the “royal road” to uncover the latent dream content, and the analyst provide his/her dream interpretation on the basis of the patient's dynamics."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,37,"The role of dream interpretation in modern psychoanalytic models has been significantly redefined compared to the initial Freud- ian conceptualisation (Pesant & Zadra, 2004)."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,3,"According to different approaches, the role of dream has been conceptualised in terms of reorganisation of the experience (Fosshage, 2002), adaptation to reality (Gazzillo et al., 2020), and co- construction of the intersubjective reality Jiménez, 2012)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,4,"Although several authors underline a “marginalisation” of dream in modern clinical psychological practice (Leonard & Dawson, 2018), it is worth noting that dreams have become an object of study also in clinical paradigms different from the psychoanalytical models (Pesant & Zadra, 2004; Velotti & Zavattini, 2019)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,5,"Among the others, the evolution of the debate about dreaming in the cognitivist frame- work (Rosner et al., 2004) represents an interesting example of the redefinition of dreamwork in psychotherapy based on novel experi- mental data, theoretical models, and clinical observations."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,6,"Beck (1971) proposed that dreams reflect the individual conception (and biases) about the self, the world, and the future, and may represent and indi- cator of changes in the emotional status."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,7,"Nevertheless, the initial need to move away from the psychoanalytical framework and the pressure to adopt an empirically verifiable clinical model led to a common dis- use of oneiric activity in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,8,"Dreams were mainly considered as psychologically meaningless epiphenomena of sleep, useless for the dreamer and in turn for the therapeutic pro- cess."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,9,"More recently, the progress in the scientific understanding of dreams has led to the reintegration of dreams among the object of interest from different epistemological paradigms in the cognitivist framework."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,10,"From a rationalist perspective, starting from the hypothe- sis that dreams are subjected to the same cognitive distortions that characterise the waking experience, it has been proposed that dreamwork can help to detect cognitive biases and maladaptive thought patterns (Barrett, 2002; Freeman & White, 2002; Hill, 1996, 2003) and promote cognitive reconstructing."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,11,"On the other hand, the constructivist paradigm moved the focus on the narrative facets of dreams and the co-construction of meaning between patient and therapist (Bara, 2012; Rezzonico & Bani, 2015; Rosner et al., 2004), with the aim to promote the emergence of relevant aspects of the personal meaning and increase the level of awareness of the patient."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,12,"The interest in the clinical use of dreams led to the development of different articulated models of dreamwork in psychotherapy, like the Description, Memory Sources, and Reformulation (DMR) model (Montangero, 2009) and the cognitive-experiential model (Hill, 1996, 2003)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,13,"Overall, Eudell-Simmons and Hilsenroth (2005) identify four main functions of dreams in psychotherapy: (a) facilitate the therapeu- tic process, (b) increase patient insight and self-awareness, (c) provide clinical information relevant for the therapist, and (d) provide a mea- sure of therapeutic change."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,14,"Clearly, a further research effort is needed to provide support for the objective and efficacy of dreamwork in psychotherapy."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,15,"Neverthe- less, the ongoing debate on this topic has led to several models of the clinical valence of dreams that appear consistent with experimental findings on oneiric activity, mainly moving from standardised symbolic interpretations of dreams to approaches based on the relationship of dreaming with individual experience and cognitive/emotional/behav-  ioural functioning."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,16,"2 | CONCLUSIONS  From the discovery of REM sleep to the present day, empirical investi- gations have considerably increased our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying dream recall."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,17,"Although compelling evidence converges in providing support to the so-called activation hypothesis and continuity hypothesis, consid- erable efforts are still needed to fully understand the neurobiological bases of oneiric processes."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,18,"Overall, we believe that (a) some results are still heterogeneous due to the application of different protocols, so a more consistent approach is needed; (b) the use of advanced techniques such as high-density EEG or source localisation methods should be encour- aged to better understand the relationship between specific oscilla- tions and dream features; (c) further studies on experimental manipulation of dreaming should be carried out, also considering the implementation of brain stimulation techniques to promote dream recall or its specific characteristics; and (d) DEBs could be used as a model to observe dream contents overcoming the problem regarding the correspondence between specific time/stage of sleep and dream production, offering new insights about the neural correlate of dreaming."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,19,"Lastly, it is worth noting that recent pandemic studies have “elec- ted” dream activity (and nightmares) as a reliable index of our emo- tional and psychological health (Frankl et al., 2021; Scarpelli et al., 2022)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,7,20,"Considering this, we underline that a translational view is needed to systematically explore the potential role of neurobiological  and experiential facets of dreaming in a clinical context."

brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,2,5,"Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function."
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,2,6,"Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation."

brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,3,3,"What discriminates people with ID from those with an incidental bad night of sleep is that they experi- ence these sleep problems at least three nights a week, for three months or more, even if the circumstances and opportunities for sleep are ideal."

brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,3,7,Symptomatic treatment of ID with hypnotics is currently discouraged because of the risk of dependency and pos- sible daytime consequences.
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,3,8,"There are, however, valid arguments against the conviction that long-term hypnotic treatment is to be strictly avoided (4)."
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,3,9,"Also, the current first-line treatment, cognitive behavior therapy for insom- nia (CBTI), does not bring sufficient relief for many (5)."

brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,4,34,Symptoms and Diagnosis  About one-third of the general population experiences symptoms of insomnia at least once in a while.
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,4,35,Symptoms of insomnia are difficulties with sleep onset or difficulties returning to sleep after waking up during the night or earlier in the morning than desired or neces- sary.
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,4,36,"These difficulties are commonly referred to as diffi- culty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), and early morning awakening (EMA), respec- tively."
brain-mechanisms-of-insomnia-new-perspectives-on-causes-and-consequences,4,37,"A diagnosis of insomnia disorder (ID) may apply if these sleep complaints occur despite adequate oppor- tunity and circumstances for sleep, if they subjectively result in some form of daytime suffering or impairment, and if they are present three times per week or more for at least three months."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,4,"Increasingly, research on sleep and health has focused on the biological mechanisms underlying these effects, which might identify those at greatest risk for adverse health consequences or might be targeted to attenuate, or even prevent, morbidity."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,5,"The purpose of the present review is to provide an integrated understanding of how sleep health (Buysse 2014) affects one salient biological mechanism, the immune system, with implications for infectious and inflammatory disease risk."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,6,"This review considers (a) the restorative role of sleep on the immune system; (J) the influence of sleep disturbance on adaptive and innate immunity; and (0) the role of sleep disturbance in risk of infectious disease and three inflammation-related dis- orders: cardiovascular disease, cancer, and major depression."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,7,"Furthermore, behavioral regulation of the immune system is embedded in a conceptual model in which inflammatory cytokines also have a reciprocal influence on sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,8,"Hence, the role of behavioral treatments that target either sleep complaints or inflammation is considered in the development of effective treatments that promote sleep and health."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,9,"SLEEP: ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP AND INSOMNIA  Sleep Characteristics  Sleep is first and foremost a behavior, which is characterized by changes in body posture and eye state; it is dimensionally evaluated by self-report, behavioral, physiological, circuit, cellular, and genetic levels of analysis (Buysse 2014)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,10,"Whereas such analyses can be used to differentiate arousal states along a continuum from fully awake to deep sleep, it is widely recognized that the elec- troencephalogram (EEG) or polysomnography is the gold standard for the objective assessment of sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,11,"Polysomnography records sleep continuity, sleep architecture, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,12,"Sleep continuity measures include the duration of sleep (i.e., total sleep time), the length of time from turning off the lights until sleep onset (i.e., sleep onset latency), and the degree to which sleep is maintained continuously throughout the night (i.e., sleep efficiency or the ratio of wake time to time in bed; awake time after sleep onset)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,13,"Sleep architecture measures categorically divide sleep into two major phases, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, with further subdivision of NREM sleep into stages 1, 2, 3, and 4, although recent research has combined stages 3 and 4 into slow-wave sleep (SWS) because of the inherent difficulties in distinguishing these latter two stages of deep sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,14,"Stage 1 is the transition between wakefulness and sleep, whereas sleep onset is generally defined to occur when spindles and K-complexes characteristically appear during stage 2."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,15,"SWS is identified by a preponderance of high-amplitude, low-frequency components as measured by EEG."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,16,"Finally, REM sleep is defined by a rapid and low-voltage EEG, similar to the activity of the brain during waking hours, with rapid and random movement of the eyes and low muscle tone."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,17,"Despite the widespread use of criteria to define stages of sleep, sleep is not quantal but rather shows a continuous progression from wakefulness to NREM and REM sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,18,Spectral analyses provide a continuous evaluation of shifts from mixed EEG frequencies to predominately lower EEG frequencies occurring during sleep.
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,19,"In humans, the transition from wakefulness to sleep occurs by entry into NREM sleep and a later transition to REM."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,20,"After a period of REM sleep, a brief arousal or awakening may occur before entry again into NREM sleep."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,21,"Over the course of the night, four to six cycles of NREM to REM sleep typically occur, with each cycle lasting about 80 to 110 minutes."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,22,"SWS predominates in the early part of the night, whereas more REM sleep occurs in the later part of the night."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,3,23,"Hence,  www.annualreviews.org + Sleep, Immunity, and Health  P45:"
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,1,"PS66CH06-Irwin  ARI 11 November 2014 14:35  as discussed below, the effects of different stages of sleep on the regulation of immunity have often been inferred from sleep deprivation studies that have disrupted sleep in the early or late part of the night."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,2,Assessment of Sleep Disturbance  Polysomnography provides a laboratory-based objective measure of sleep.
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,3,"Despite being the gold standard for sleep assessment, polysomnography may not adequately characterize sleep occurring at home or disturbances of sleep over time."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,4,"To estimate sleep patterns in a natural sleep setting without the invasiveness of polysomnography, sleep actigraphy is used."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,5,"The watch-shaped acti- graph estimates sleep patterns and circadian rhythms and is coupled with a sleep diary, in which the patient reports sleep onset and morning awakening."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,6,"As such, actigraphy provides reasonably accurate sleep continuity indices as compared to polysomnography (Ancoli-Israel et al."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,7,2003).
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,8,"In addition to the evaluation of sleep by polysomnography, actigraphy, and sleep diaries, the patient’s own sleep perceptions play a critical role in the assessment of sleep disturbance and diagnosis of insomnia."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,9,"Indeed, in a study of insomniacs and controls, polysomnography testing provided little information to confirm or exclude insomnia, and a large multicenter field trial resulted in similar findings (for a review, see Vgontzas et al."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,10,2013).
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,11,"The American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not recommend polysomnography for the routine assessment of insomnia, although it is helpful in the evaluation of other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea (Littner et al."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,4,13,"Consistent with these clinical perspectives, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is based solely on subjective complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, interrupted or nonrestorative sleep, and associated impairments in daytime functioning, which must be present at least three nights per week and last for three months or longer (Am."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,5,14,"As such, the adaptive immune system coordinates a specific response to an infectious challenge by a sequence of coordinated steps (Murphy 2011)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,5,15,"In response to an infectious challenge, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages or dendritic cells are attracted to a site of intrusion, take up invading antigen, and then migrate to local lymph nodes."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,5,16,"Within the lymph node, the APCs present antigen to T helper (Th) cells followed by release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 from the APCs."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,5,17,"In response to these inflammatory signals, Th cells activate, proliferate, and differentiate into one of two predominant cell types, which serve to help B cells become antibody-producing cells (i.e., plasma cells) or leave the lymph node to coordinate cytotoxic cell responses that, if successful, eliminate the pathogen."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,5,18,"Once complete, a fraction of these antigen-specific Th cells as well as cytotoxic T cells and B cells survive to provide an immunological memory that achieves a more rapid response when that specific infectious challenge occurs again."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,5,Proinflammatory cytokines also signal sites of injury or infection by activating the release of chemokines that recruit immune cells to the site of inflammatory activity (Murphy 2011).
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,6,Innate Immunity  Innate immunity is evolutionally older than adaptive immunity and serves as the body’s first line of defense against tissue damage and microbial infection (Medzhitov 2008).
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,7,"Composed of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells that constantly circulate in the body, the innate immune system uses invariant receptors to detect a wide variety of pathogens."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,8,"Activation of these cells leads to a rapid (i.e., minutes to hours) cascade of inflammatory processes that help contain an infection and ultimately promote healing and recovery (Medzhitov 2008)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,9,"When receptors of innate immune cells recognize hard-wired and highly conserved features of microbes or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the acute-phase response is triggered, which leads to an increase in inflammatory activity that can occur both locally (i.e., at the site of tissue injury or infection) and systemically."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,10,"This recognition strategy, which uses a relatively small number of immune cell types to detect and generate a response to a wide range of microbial diversity, is termed pattern recognition, and innate immune receptors that use this strategy are called pattern recognition receptors (Medzhitov 2008)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,11,"Among pattern recognition receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are found on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells that drive inflammation (Medzhitov 2008)."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,15,"Activation of NF-«B, for example, leads to the transcription of proinflammatory immune response genes such as TNF-a and IL-1 and the translation and production of proinflammatory cytokines that serve to coordinate the inflammatory response (Karin 2006)."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,16,"Hence, intracellular processes that occur at the level of the genome most proximally regulate the inflammatory response."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,6,17,"As described below, sleep plays an important role in the regulation of the adaptive and innate immune responses; evidence indicates that sleep disturbance induces a downregulation of adaptive immunity, as indexed by an impaired response to infectious challenge, along with an upregula- tion of innate immune responses, as indexed by increases in cellular and genomic markers of inflammation."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,9,5,"SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE RISK  Given that nocturnal sleep is a prominent regulator of adaptive immune responses, it is logical to consider the effects of sleep disturbance on this branch of the immune system during the day and after a period of sleep disturbance."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,9,6,"However, in some instances when sleep loss is prolonged or severe, such as total night sleep deprivation for several nights, the immune effects may not be specific to sleep disturbance, as there can be marked activation of stress response pathways such as the HPA axis during such profound sleep loss."
WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,9,7,"Yet, when the sleep loss is limited to a single night or part of the night, or when sleep is fragmented as often occurs in naturalistic settings, activation of stress pathways appears limited to increases of SNS activity (Irwin et al."

WhySleep Is Important for Health- A Psychoneuroimmunology Perspective,9,10,"Experimental Sleep Loss and Adaptive Immunity  Experimental sleep loss, as defined by experimentally induced deprivation of sleep during all or part of the night, has minimal effects on immune cell numbers, in part due to the predominant circadian regulation of almost all white blood cell subpopulations."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,6,© |  Summary  Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,7,"Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,8,"Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnos- tic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Associa- tion, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,9,"Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,10,Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,11,"Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the rou- tine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,12,Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and psycho- neurobiological approaches.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,13,The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep- wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/ restless rapid eye movement sleep.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,14,"Cognitive-behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia worldwide."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,15,Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,16,"With respect to therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,17,"However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia,  fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behav-  ioural mechanisms underlying insomnia."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,2,response/non-response and the associated development of tailored and novel inter-  ventions also require investigation.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,3,Recent studies suggest that treatment of insom-  nia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global  burden of mental disorders.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,4,"KEYWORDS  anxiety, CBT-I, depression, insomnia, insomnia models, prevention, treatment guidelines  1 | DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA DISORDER (ID)—DSM-5, ICSD-3, ICD-11  In the last 50 years all medical diagnostic classification systems have included ID."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,5,"DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association) in its previous versions DSM-III-R/DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1987, 1998) suggested a distinc- tion between primary and secondary insomnias, whereas DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) heralded a paradigmatic change by establishing ID as an overarching diagnostic category, elimi- nating artificial distinctions."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,6,"The ICSD (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) in its third version (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014) confirmed this new nosology (see Table 1; diagnostic criteria for chronic ID according to ICSD-3)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,7,"The ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition; World Health Organization, 1993) distinguished between organic and non-organic sleep disorders; however, ICD-11 will follow the avenue paved by DSM-5 and ICSD-3 (World Health Organization, 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,8,"When analysing the “new” criteria for ID all systems list both night-time and daytime symptoms and, notably, the symptom of non-restorative sleep was dropped from the criteria due to lack of specificity."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,9,"Abandoning the distinction between primary/secondary insomnia constituted a major advance in acknowledging that insomnia fre- quently is not just a symptom of any other somatic or mental disorder, but constitutes an independent disorder, deserving specific consider- ation in clinical practice."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,10,"It is important to note that insomnia probably more frequently occurs as a co-morbid condition together with somatic and mental disorders, than it does occur in its isolated form."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,11,"DSM-5, ICSD-3 and ICD-11 pay respect to this by explicitly allowing co-morbidity."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,12,"Furthermore, it turned out that cognitive-behavioural treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) not only has decisive effects on sleep/ insomnia complaints, but also positively influences somatic/mental co-morbidities and quality of life."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,13,"At present, evidence is accumulating that insomnia treatment with CBT-I may even have surplus benefits with respect to general treatment and prevention especially of mental disorders (Benz et al., 2020; Cheng et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,14,"2019; Hertenstein et al., 2022; Irwin et al., 2022; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,15,"Nevertheless, ID as a “one size fits all” category is seen critical by many working in the field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,16,"There is still a lively and ongoing discussion about different insomnia phenotypes, for example focussing on the main nocturnal complaint, that is, insomnia with or without “objec-  tive” short sleep (Vgontzas et al., 2013), or sleep-onset insomnia  versus sleep-maintenance insomnia (Pillai et al., 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,17,"Indeed, the profile of dominant sleep complaints matters for the risk of develop- ing first-onset major depressive disorder (Blanken et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,18,"How- ever, subtyping based on sleep characteristics may not be that robust, even across 2 nights Johann et al., 2017), let alone across months or years (Edinger et al., 2011)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,19,"Apparently, insomnia complaints change over time."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,20,"More robust insomnia subtypes surfaced by multivariate profiling of personality features rather than sleep features (Blanken, Benjamins et al., 2019)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,2,"concerning diagnostic procedures, however, should be highlighted here."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,3,The use of sleep diaries constitutes an integral part of insomnia assessment for both research and/or clinical purposes (e.g.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,4,"consensus sleep diary by Carney et al., 2012)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,5,Sleep diaries are easy to apply and to evaluate.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,6,"Sleep diaries focus on the experience of sleep and can be reviewed by the clinician as they are presented, but the inherent information can also be used to create highly informative graphical displays of sleep and bedtimes (Figure 1)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,7,"Beyond sleep diaries, other insomnia-specific questionnaires like the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien et al., 2001) or the Sleep Condi- tion Indicator (Espie et al., 2014) should be used."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,8,"For both clinical and fundamental research, it is favourable to take note of the recommendations for a standard research assessment of insomnia (Buysse et al., 2006)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,9,"Several paradigms were developed to elucidate specific aspects of insomnia, for example, the attentional bias paradigm (Espie et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,10,This paradigm suggests that patients with chronic insomnia have developed a bias in their perception and processing of stimuli related to insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,11,"Other highly promising paradigms investigate failing overnight amelioration of distress, which seems key to persistence of hyperarousal (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,12,"At present, not yet being ready for standard clinical practice, it is conceivable that these paradigms might be used in the future to measure responsiveness to CBT-I, also in combination with neuroimaging methods."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,13,"As the diagnosis of insomnia is solely based on subjective com- plaints and their measurement, it remains a matter of long-standing debate what the role of technical methods like actigraphy or poly- somnography (PSG) might be."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,14,It is a highly controversial issue as to whether PSG should be part of the diagnostic process.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,15,"Doubtlessly PSG helps to unravel suspected occult pathology of sleep, that is, peri- odic limb movements during sleep (periodic limb movement disorder) or sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,16,"US guidelines clearly deny the usefulness of PSG to diagnose insomnia (Kushida et al., 2005), whereas guidelines of the German and the European Sleep Research Society (Riemann, Baum, et al., 2017; Riemann, Baglioni, et al., 2017) suggest that PSG be used for patients with therapy-refractory insomnia who have not responded to a previous adequate “dose” of pharmaco- or psychotherapy."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,17,The frequently described discrepancy between subjective (i.e.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,18,data from sleep diaries) and objective data (PSG) called paradoxi- cal insomnia or sleep state misperception is seen as a major clinical and scientific challenge.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,19,"PSG contrasted with subjective data does not reveal as pronounced disturbances of sleep as indicated by subjective data (Feige et al., 2008)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,20,"A PSG meta-analysis revealed mean total sleep time differences between insomnia and good sleepers of about 25 min, whereas subjective estimates demonstrated an almost 2-hr difference (Baglioni, Regen, et al., 2014; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,21,Traditional PSG reveals only a glimpse of the brain activ- ity during sleep.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,22,"Advanced analyses have commenced to reveal elec- troencephalogram (EEG) correlates of subjective wakefulness during sleep, like simultaneous wake-like and sleep-like brain activity in peo- ple with insomnia (Christensen et al., 2019; Stephan et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,23,"Furthermore, classification of individual insomnia patients based on their PSG and EEG power-spectral variables can distinguish between those with objective short sleep and those with sleep state mis- perception (Kao et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,24,"Accordingly, the “misperception” may in fact be “mismeasurement”: an inappropriate use or interpretation of traditional PSG features by clinicians, rather than inappropriate inter- pretation of subjective experiences by people with insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,25,It is important to bear in mind that these same challenges apply to mental disorders in general.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,26,"There is no objective “test” for depression, anxi- ety or psychosis."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,27,"The validation of any such tests needs to apply self- report coupled with clinical judgement as the “gold-standard.” Vgontzas and colleagues have postulated that the long-term health consequences of insomnia may be related specifically to objec- tive short sleep duration of less than 6 hr (Vgontzas et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,28,"However, patients with short sleep insomnia during one night do not fulfil that criteria on another night, and an increased risk of hyperten- sion in short sleeping insomnia could not be replicated (Johann et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,29,"Also, the hypothesis that the presence of objectively documented short sleep may be of relevance for the choice of therapy (Riemann et al., 2011), that is, pharmacotherapy for insomnia patients with objective short sleep duration versus psychotherapy for insomnia patients with objective normal sleep duration, has yet to be resolved and deserves further consideration (Vgontzas et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,30,More details will be provided in the aetiology/pathophysiology section.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,31,Figure 2 gives some examples of PSG determined sleep profiles of a  good sleeper and two patients with ID.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,32,"2 | EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INSOMNIA AND INSOMNIA AS A RISK FACTOR FOR OTHER DISORDERS  Insomnia more frequently afflicts females than males (60% versus 40%), and its prevalence increases with age (for an overview, see Ohayon, 2002)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,33,"The European Academy for CBT-I has summarized prevalence data for ID across some European countries (Baglioni et al., 2020), varying strongly from country to country."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,34,"Data for Germany indicate a prevalence of 5.7%, whereas French surveys indi- cate figures up to 20%."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,35,"On average, approximately 10% of the adult European population suffer from chronic insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,36,The heterogenous data clearly stress the need for the prospective collection of pan-European samples with state-of-the-art methods to obtain the full picture for planning of insomnia healthcare services.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,37,The costs of insomnia for the individual and society are stagger- ing: it was demonstrated that insomnia conveys increased risks for cardiovascular diseases (Li et al.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,38,"2014), obesity and diabetes (Anothaisintawee et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2018), depression (Baglioni et al, 2011; Hertenstein et al, 2019), anxiety (Hertenstein et al., 2019) and suicide (Pigeon et al., 2012)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,3,39,Wickwire (2019) reported that untreated insomnia leads to increased all-cause healthcare utilization based on a randomly selected and nationally representative sample from the USA.

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,16,"Interestingly, the brain tissues and cell types expressing sets of insomnia risk genes are not pri- marily part of the known circuitry regulating sleep but are rather part of circuitries involved in emotion regulation (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,17,"Still, for completeness, a discussion on the development and maintenance of insomnia should include the neurobiological mecha- nisms of sleep, notably homeostatic and biological time-keeping mechanisms (Borbély, 1982)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,18,"The flip-flop switch model of sleep regu- lation (Saper et al., 2005) suggests a bistable switch mechanism between sleep and wake promoting centres of neuronal cell groups."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,19,"Wakefulness is governed by a network of cell populations in the hypothalamus (including orexinergic neurons), basal forebrain and brain stem, activating thalamus and cortical structures."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,20,These struc-  tures include and extend beyond the cell groups in the reticular  formation of the brainstem (originally described as ascending reticular activating system).
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,21,"The main sleep-inducing centres are located in the ventrolateral-preoptic nucleus (VLPO), which becomes active during sleep and inhibits all major wake-promoting centres in the hypothala- mus and brain stem, with the neurotransmitters galanin and gamma- aminobutyric acid."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,22,"The VLPO receives afferent input from each of the major monoaminergic systems, and is inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,23,"A mutual inhibitory circuit between both systems, the wake and the sleep system, leads to a flip-flop switch with “sharp” transi- tions between sleeping and waking."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,26,A hyperactivity of the arousal sys- tem or a hypoactivity of the sleep system or both simultaneously could thus “drive” the insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,27,"Circadian and homeostatic mecha- nisms are also involved in this switch process, and it has been specu- lated that a dysfunctional “key switch” (see above) could play a role in the pathogenesis of insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,28,"According to the two-process model of sleep regulation (Borbély, 1982), sleep-wake behaviour is governed by circadian time-keeping mechanisms and a homeostatically con- trolled process S, representing the sleep drive."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,29,Being out of synchrony with the internal body clock (e.g.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,30,due to shift work) or having a decreased sleep drive would logically result in sleep complaints.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,31,"Indeed, the main effective component of CBT-I, sleep restriction, is hypothesized to act on the sleep drive (Maurer et al., 2018), and long- term effectiveness of CBT-I improves with the addition of circadian interventions (Dekker et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,32,"Notwith- standing these effects, decades of research in insomnia have failed to reveal circadian and homeostatic mechanisms as primary factors involved the origin and pathophysiology of the majority of people suf- fering from ID (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,33,"One might conclude that enhancement of homeostatic sleep pressure and support of circadian rhythm amplitude alleviates insomnia, but that we may have to look beyond hourglass and clock to find underlying causes predisposing to insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,34,"A third factor involved in sleep and predisposing to insomnia is emotion (Saper et al., 2005)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,35,"This factor is frequently overlooked, in spite of the ubiquitous experience that sleep initiation is difficult under threatening conditions—no matter what our hourglass and clock suggest."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,36,"Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective this would be extremely disadvantageous."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,37,"An increasing number of observations suggests a key role of this third factor in the origin and pathophysiol- ogy of the predisposition to insomnia (for review, see Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,38,"For example, the trait to exhibit a pronounced dis- turbed sleep response to stressful events has been shown to be a major risk factor for insomnia (Drake et al., 2014)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,9,"Hyperarousal includes physiological, cognitive and emotional components, and has been considered a stable characteristic of peo- ple with insomnia both during the night and during the day (Morin et al., 2015; Riemann et al., 2010, 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,10,"It has been demonstrated that patients with insomnia show increased levels of autonomic activ- ity (though the issue is discussed critically with respect to heart rate variability; Dodds et al., 2017) and an overactivity of the HPA-axis, as documented by increased levels of cortisol output during day- and  night-time (see meta-analysis by Dressle et al., 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,11,"Central nervous  system (CNS) indicators of hyperarousal in people with insomnia are increased amounts of micro-arousals and increases in fast EEG fre- quencies (in the sigma and beta bands) during sleep (Christensen et al., 2019; Feige et al., 2013; Perlis et al., 1997, 2001; Spiegelhalder et al., 2012), and also wake EEG shows signatures of increased excita- tion (Colombo, Ramautar, et al., 2016; Colombo, Wei, et al., 2016) and somatic awareness and responsivity (Wei et al., 2016; Wei, Blanken, & Van Someren, 2018; Wei, Ramautar, et al., 2018)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,4,(2021) used an event-related potentials paradigm to demonstrate that ID patients differed from good sleepers by showing reduced P2 amplitudes only in phasic REM sleep.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,5,These studies highlight a special role of REM sleep for insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,6,"The mechanisms underlying this special role of REM sleep in the predisposition, perpetuation and psychiatric consequences were addressed in a series of seminal studies (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,7,"In brief, Wassing et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,8,showed that the restless REM sleep that is characteristic of people with insomnia interferes with overnight adaptation in limbic circuits of the brain.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,9,"The consequential difficulties with dissolving of distress could be key to the development and perpetuation of hyperarousal as well to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, as supported by other studies (Halonen et al., 2021; Pesonen et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,10,"Restless sleep lacks the prolonged silencing of the locus coeruleus and consequential drop in cerebral noradrenaline that characterizes normal restful REM sleep (Kjearby et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,11,"Because REM sleep is a period of pronounced limbic reactivation of emotional memory traces, it has been hypothe- sized that the increased level of noradrenaline during restless REM sleep interferes with the synaptic plasticity processes underlying adaptation of the neuronal engrams that represent distress, and could even result in sensitization, indicating maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,12,"Others have proposed that the low level of nor- adrenaline during REM sleep is key to restore the noradrenergic tone, to enable a low tonic and high phasic locus coeruleus activity during wakefulness (Goldstein & Walker, 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,13,"Restless REM sleep thus has a specific contribution to “emo- tional” perpetuating factors, and may explain why patients with insomnia are so prone to develop anxiety and depressive disorders in the long run."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,14,"Indeed, sleep has been conceptualized as a basic psycho- physiological process that is fundamental for stress, behaviour and emotion regulation (Hagger, 2010; Palmer & Alfano, 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,15,"Consis- tently, most mental disorders are associated with sleep impairment (Baglioni et al., 2016), and insomnia-related problems in children have been linked with difficulties in socio-emotional development (Sadeh et al., 2014; Vermeulen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,16,"In adults, insomnia has been found to be a predictor of years-long lingering of emotional distress (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019), of depres- sion, and of anxiety disorders (Baglioni et al., 2011; Hertenstein et al., 2019; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,17,"Experimental studies have shown that patients with insomnia report more negative emotions than good sleepers (McCrae et al., 2008; Scott & Judge, 2006)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,18,"Psychophysiolog- ical studies have also evidenced an emotional bias in people with insomnia to sleep-related stimuli with negative valence compared with good sleepers (Baglioni et al., 2010; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,19,"Perpetuating factors also include inadequate “behaviours”, like prolonged bedtimes, irregular sleep-wake schedules, napping during the day and other maladaptive behaviours, such as using alcohol to  combat insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,20,"Usually, these strategies are attempted to  compensate for lost sleep; however, in the end insomnia is maintained and exacerbated by decreasing sleep drive."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,21,"In addition, “cognitive perpetuating factors” have been identified, such as beliefs, worry and attentional bias (Espie, 2002; Harvey, 2002; Morin et al., 2007)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,22,These cognitions include unrealistic beliefs about sleep requirements and excessive worry for not meeting these stan- dards.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,23,"In recent years, the literature has emphasized the role of selec- tive attention processes in people with insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,24,"Specifically, it has been argued that the attentional system of patients with insomnia may be abnormally sensitive to sleep-related information (Harris et al., 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,25,"It has been hypothesized that such attention bias may exacerbate sleep-related rumination and lead to sleep effort (Espie et al., 2006; Harvey, 2002)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,26,"Summarizing, acute precipitating life events can “set the wheels in motion’—acute insomnia is triggered."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,27,"The question of why most individuals who develop acute insomnia do not go on to develop the chronic condition has not yet been clarified (Ellis et al., 2012)—but likely involves genetic and early life stress-induced neurobiological vulnerability to keep “the train rolling.” A complex network of associ- ated symptoms including cognitive-, emotional- and cerebral hyper- arousal, unstable REM sleep and maladaptive behaviours will keep the furnace burning."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,28,"Sleep-preventing learned associations (conditioning effects) are strongly involved in this process as well, giving credit to Bootzin's assumption that in insomnia the original connection between the bed (stimulus) and the behaviour of sleep (response) has been lost or “unlearned” (Bootzin et al., 1991)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,29,"The CBT-I (see below) mainly targets the perpetuating factors, for example, relaxation techniques and mindfulness aim to address psy- chophysiological hyperarousal; sleep hygiene, stimulus control and sleep restriction try to correct maladaptive behaviours and enhance sleep drive; whereas cognitive strategies aim to alter “racing thoughts”, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and to reduce nocturnal  worrying and ruminations."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,4,The CBT-I comprises a family of interventions and is not “one” homogenous therapeutic strategy per se (Table 2).
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,5,"The CBT-I is in essence a multicomponent approach, comprising cognitive and behavioural parts, within each of which domain there is a wide range of treatment options."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,7,"Cognitive techniques include reappraisal, cognitive control and paradoxical intention."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,8,"There is also a range of relaxation therapies, and sleep hygiene education, although not effective as a standalone treatment, is commonly part of the CBT-I toolkit."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,12,"Logically therefore CBT-I is not “a treatment” but is “a system of cognitive and behavioural therapeutics”, akin to pharmacotherapy (which is not a drug treatment but a “pharmaceutical approach” to clinical care; Espie, 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,13,"The history of evidence-based psychother- apy (in most disorders) reveals a period of time during which there was a tendency towards “lumping” of therapeutic elements, rather than the creation of precision techniques that “may” be used in com- bination."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,14,"This is certainly true of the non-pharmacological manage- ment of insomnia, and the term CBT-I has for the past 20 years or more been used rather generically in the literature because the major- ity of studies have deployed a CBT-I package."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,17,"Interestingly, of late, there has been renewed interest in single-component therapies."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,18,"We now find ourselves unpicking or deconstructing CBT to evaluate its active component treatments, and even its active treatment ingredi- ents."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,19,"The best example is sleep restriction therapy (SRT), widely reg- arded to be the most effective element of CBT (Edinger et al., 2021a; Maurer, Schneider et al., 2021)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,25,"It was beyond the scope of this (group) to recommend a specific CBT protocol, and “these variations did not appear to systematically impact the effectiveness of the treat- ment” (p. 261)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,26,"This evidences the versatility and robustness of what is sometimes now referred to as CBTx (cognitive and behavioural therapeutics), that is, a “therapeutic formulary”, where not everyone needs the same content, or the same order of content (Espie, 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,27,"Analysis of how SRT is configured suggests there is gross variability between studies and protocols (Kyle et al., 2015); it would be prudent to establish what is the most effective combination of SRT parame- ters, including tailoring to presenting insomnia phenotype."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,28,"Indeed, the widespread development of “precision medicine” (Ginsburg & Willard, 2009; Jain, 2002) has spawned interest in how “personalized behavioural sleep medicine” for insomnia may evolve in the future (Kyle et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,29,"Despite the impressive evidence base for CBT-l, its recognition internationally as the treatment of first choice for the management of insomnia and the fact that the CBTx formulary of treatments is quite wide ranging, in practice the majority of insomnia patients seeking medical help continue to receive medication."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,30,The issue here is not so much overprescribing of drugs as it is under-provision of CBT-I.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,31,Two innovations have been developed to address this problem.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,32,"The first, at the level of the treatment itself there has been growing interest in, and a rapidly accelerating evidence base for digital CBT-I, that is CBT-I delivered by fully automated web and mobile means."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,33,"The sec- ond, at the level of the service, has been the development of the “stepped care” model of insomnia service delivery."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,34,"The effectiveness of digital CBT-I has been robustly and rigor- ously demonstrated against psychological placebo (Espie et al., 2012), attention control (Christensen et al., 2016; Kaldo et al., 2015), sleep hygiene (Espie et al., 2019; Ritterband et al., 2017; Vedaa et al., 2020), waitlist (Zachariae et al., 2018) and usual care (Freeman et al., 2017) in a range of clinical and co-morbid populations."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,35,"Several meta-analyses report large between-group effects on insomnia severity, and medium effects on sleep diary outcomes (Seyffert et al., 2016; Soh et al., 2020; Zachariae et al., 2016), and benefits to sleep are durable, being maintained up to a year and beyond (Blom et al., 2017; Luik et al., 2020; Vedaa et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,36,"Whereas meta-analyses report effect sizes in the range of face-to-face CBT-| thereby suggesting non-inferi- ority, head-to-head comparisons have shown mixed findings (Blom et al., 2015; De Bruin et al., 2016; Kallestad et al., 2021; Lancee et al., 2016)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,37,"It seems likely, however, that the evolution of highly engaging clinically evidenced software will address engagement and treatment implementation challenges that are apparent for all forms of CBT-I delivery."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,38,"It may also be the case that differences exist between different digital CBT-I formats (Hasan et al., 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,39,These outstanding questions warrant further investigation.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,40,"Beyond improved sleep, digital CBT-l, like “traditional” CBT-l, yields benefits to additional clinical and functional outcomes of rele- vance to insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,41,"Several studies have documented reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression, including in individuals with clin- ically significant depressive symptoms (Blom et al., 2015, 2017; Cheng et al., 2019; Henry et al., 2021; Pillai et al, 2015; van der Zweerde     wos} PapHO[UMOG ""F “ZZOZ “698TSIEL     LOT opywos:Kaptav-Kreaquyar     -IGET OUNTUG APTENY “FOIE     g S 8 § 2 & 5     puoo-pur-suus9} (1109      jn x0y Aaeaqny auyUG A2qtyy     8 & < ° 2 3 ="

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,22,"From a scientific perspective, digital CBT-I confers advantages such that it permits examination of potential mediators of treatment effects using a standardized therapeutic approach."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,23,"Large randomized-controlled trials and secondary analyses show that insom- nia symptom reduction mediates improvements in mental health symptoms (Freeman et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2021), and improve- ments in quality of life, health and wellbeing, and cognitive function (Espie et al., 2019; Kyle, Hurry, et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,24,This evidence therefore supports treating insomnia complaints whenever it presents.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,25,"Emerging data also suggest that demographic variables including age, race, gen- der or socio-economic status do not moderate the effectiveness of digital CBT-I (Cheng et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,26,Real-world evidence further underscores the value of digital CBT-I.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,27,"Recent uncontrolled data evaluating digital CBT-I in existing healthcare settings in the UK show reductions in insomnia and aug- mentation of the effects of in-person therapy for anxiety and depres- sion (Cliffe et al., 2020; Luik et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,28,"2017; Stott et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,29,"Importantly, from a health economic perspective, analyses suggest that digital CBT-I is cost-effective, and may lead to cost savings if made available at scale (Darden et al., 2021; Sampson et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,30,This growing body of evidence behind digital CBT-| has led to increased recognition of it as a viable and effective treatment option.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,31,"Indeed, in the USA, Somryst has been cleared by the FDA as a pre- scription digital therapeutic (Morin, 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,32,"Likewise, Sleepio (www."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,33,"sleepio.com) is widely available in the USA, integrated into healthcare  pathways and on the digital formulary, and is available in major parts of the UK National Health Service."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,34,"By overcoming the barriers preventing access to therapist- delivered CBT-I, digital CBT-I has the potential to provide access to clinically effective, evidenced-based and guideline-recommended insomnia treatment."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,35,"These fundamental properties of effectiveness and scalability make digital CBT-I attractive as a first-line insomnia interven- tion, providing an accessible alternative to pharmacotherapy (Figure 4)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,36,"The stepped-care model is a population health service approach to providing people with insomnia with access to evidence-based care (Espie, 2009; Espie et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,37,"Stepped care is often conceptualized as a pyramid consisting of different levels, with at the bottom the least specialized help applicable for those with less severe and more generic complaints and highly specialized help for those with more severe, complex and rare problems as the top."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,38,The level of interven- tion is naturally not arbitrary; treatment is tailored to and based on the needs of the patient and the nature of their complaints.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,39,"The num- ber of steps in any stepped care model would be determined by the levels of intervention that are proven and available, and by what within the healthcare system would be affordable."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,4,"The stepped care model conserves  expert resources for more complex and treatment-resistant cases  of insomnia, as it has considerable “scalability”, particularly when fully automated."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,5,"Another approach at this level might be using self-help books of good standing, perhaps as part of a “books on prescription” scheme."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,6,"Next in the hierarchy might be insomnia services that require some in-person support, but thought would be given to how such care could be provided with efficiency."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,7,"Examples here might include telehealth rather than in a clinic, and the use of small group therapy rather than individual treatment."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,8,Other factors to be considered would be the nature of the treatment itself and the expertise of the therapist.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,9,"For example, it could be possible to train healthcare workers in the provision of manualized CBT-I without them having to have a deep understanding of sleep medicine or mental health (training pri- mary care nurses, for example)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,10,"This approach is very protocol-driven and can be readily standardized (Kyle, Madigan, et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,11,As you then continue up the hierarchy there is greater need for insomnia- specific expertise and for the use of tailored therapy.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,12,At the peak of the pyramid the likelihood is that not only specialist expertise but also specialized facilities such as those available at a sleep centre may be required to address the needs of the most complex patients.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,13,Stepped care systems require decision algorithms for two pro- cesses.

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,15,"5 | FUTURE PERSPECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO DIAGNOSIS, MEASUREMENT, AETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; NEW TREATMENTS  Given the drastic changes we have been witnessing concerning insomnia and its diagnosis, pathophysiology/aetiology and treatment in the last 30 years, one might be tempted to answer the question “Can we rest yet?” (Harvey & Tang, 2003) with “Yes!.” However, this would be premature and inadequate with respect to the many open questions still facing us in the insomnia field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,16,"Therefore, at this point, we would like to highlight some issues/avenues for future research and clinical practice we consider of utmost importance."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,17,"Given the fact that at present we have reached the unique situa- tion that all major diagnostic systems (DSM-5, ICSD-3, ICD-11) have agreed upon ID (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014; Ameri- can Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 2019), the situation seems ideal that all types of studies into ID use more or less the same diagnostic criteria, which would be ideal to make data coming from all over the world easily comparable."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,18,"This would also entail homogenization of our diagnostic and research instruments (questionnaires, PSG, etc.)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,3,"In this regard, pooling data from different sleep labs could be ben- eficial in order to address the issues of small sample sizes and poor replicability in the insomnia field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,4,This would require the use of stan- dard methodology and paradigms across different labs.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,5,"The UK Bio- bank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk; see Allen et al., 2014 for a detailed description), a large biomedical database including a sample of about 500,000 adults, has already proven to be useful for insomnia research (Uansen et al., 2019; Kyle et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,6,"Although the UK Biobank is not specifically optimized for insomnia research, cross- validation showed the available phenotype to very accurately match diagnosed insomnia patients (Hammerschlag et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,7,"Given the costs and artificiality of the traditional sleep laboratory, home-based easy to apply measures need to be developed, allowing repetitive CNS-based measurements in the natural environments of our patients, reaching beyond actigraphy (Debener et al., 2015; Mikkelsen et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,8,This would allow to study the dynamics of fea- tures reflecting the sleep drive and REM sleep characteristics longitu- dinally and in relation to different treatments and their outcomes in much more detail.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,9,"Given the prominence of the hyperarousal concept in almost all insomnia models, one should also start to think about developing a hyperarousal test, which at best could be applied during daytime or rou- tine office/hospital hours."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,10,"One could think about a stress/challenge par- adigm, measuring autonomous nervous system activity (e.g."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,11,"heart rate, galvanic skin response, etc."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,12,"), cortisol as main marker of the stress response and EEG during baseline, rest and different stress conditions."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,13,"One of the best accepted stress paradigms now is the Trier social stress test—its usefulness has already been tested (Chen et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,14,"Alterna- tively, probably just the instruction “please try to sleep now” probably might offset a marked stress response in insomniacs."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,15,"Such a psycho- physiological paradigm administered during the day can also easily be coupled with neuroimaging methods, that is, functional magnetic reso- nance imaging."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,16,"Needless to say, these data should be coupled with descriptive questionnaire data."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,17,"Assuming that it will be possible to develop an easy to apply and valid hyperarousal test, this instrument could be used for phenotyping, relating the data to (epi-)genetic data, general diagnostics, differential-therapeutics and therapy outcomes."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,18,"Given the emerging evidence of maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021), essential insights could require repeated assessment of hyperarousal from evening to morning across recorded nights."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,19,"Analyses can then address which sleep features determine the overnight fate of distress—which could range from full adaptation even to maladaptive sensitization (Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al, 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,20,"Nevertheless, deeper insights into the mechanisms of hyperarousal in insomnia, its causes and consequences for cognitive processes and brain health in general are needed."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,21,This will help to fur- ther increase the value of the hyperarousal concept for insomnia research and could also help to identify a valid hyperarousal test.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,22,"Interestingly, also with therapeutics at present we have reached a  unique situation concerning treatment—all presently published  ai 11 of 18  relevant guidelines agree that CBT-I should be the first-line treatment     for insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,23,A statement like this would have caused a lot of many raised eyebrows even just 10 years ago!
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,24,"This development is probably because on one hand, the CBT-I literature is blooming and has gener- ated a solid and ever-increasing evidence base, but on the other hand maybe also due to a stagnation in the sector of hypnotic development and the withdrawal of many major players in psychopharmacology from CNS-oriented Research & Development."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,25,It has to be judged in the next few years whether the worldwide introduction of orexin receptor antagonists will markedly alter the hypnotic market.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,26,"From a future perspective, we would like to suggest that research into the roles of histamine and noradrenaline and sleep regulation could lead to new discoveries (Thakkar, 2011; Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,27,"Maybe also approaches encompassing non-invasive brain stimulation might com- plement insomnia treatment strategies (Herrero Babiloni et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,28,"A better understanding of the psychoneurobiological mechanisms of insomnia is urgently needed to monitor and evaluate treatment effects of CBT-I beyond subjective measures, and further develop complementary treatment strategies."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,29,"First, preliminary findings sug- gest that 1 night of experimental sleep restriction (delaying bedtime by 2 hr) may help to stabilize restless REM sleep (Kao et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,30,"However, it remains to be seen whether this stabilization is observed in therapeutic SRT, and whether it translates into improvements in regulation of emotional distress, hyperarousal and the risk of develop- ing mental disorders."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,31,"Second, notwithstanding the established efficacy of CBT-lI, it is important to acknowledge that two out of five patients do not show full remission, even after boosting CBT-I effects with subsequent pharmacological treatment (Morin et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,32,We still have very limited insight into who will respond and who will not.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,33,"Novel graph theory-based analyses like network outcome analysis and network intervention analysis may reveal how non-responders differ in their initial symptom profiles and trajectories of change of symp- toms during the intervention (Blanken, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Blanken et al., 2020; Blanken, van der Zweerde, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,34,Pinpointing such differences could provide leads to novel strategies.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,35,"Also the gradual wearing off of initial benefits of CBT-I deserves attention (van der Zweerde et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,36,"Two recent studies indicate that beneficial effects of CBT-I may be preserved longer if CBT-I is combined with interventions aimed at supporting circadian rhythms (Dekker et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,37,"What we consider probably the most important challenge for the future is the integration of CBT-I into the standard treatment of patients with mental disorders, especially anxiety and depression."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,11,38,"It is known that almost all mental disorders are afflicted with disturbances of sleep continuity (Baglioni et al., 2016), and we also know that pay- ing proper therapeutic respect to including insomnia-related compo- nents into the overall therapeutic concept will improve outcomes in general and speed up the therapeutic process (Gee et al., 2019; Hertenstein et al., 2022; Manber et al., 2008)."

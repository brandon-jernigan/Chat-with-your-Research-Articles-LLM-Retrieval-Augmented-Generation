What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,1,"Additionally, a growing number of studies have suggested that dream experience might be considered an expression of human wellbeing (Frankl et al., 2021; Scarpelli et al., 2022) and has a pivotal role in emotional regulation, as suggested by some neurobiological findings (Nielsen & Lara-Carrasco, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,2,"For instance, dream recall and night- mare frequency increase when subjects are exposed to adverse and trau- matic events (e.g., Hartmann & Brezler, 2008; Nielsen et al., 2006; Sandman et al., 2013; Tempesta et al., 2013)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,3,"Also, the qualitative charac- teristics of dream reports change in parallel with the emotional charge of waking experiences (Schredl, 2006; Scarpelli et al., 2021)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,4,"It should be highlighted that psychoanalysis had primacy in dream research until the discovery of the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1953)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,5,"The interpretation of oneiric con- tents was one of the main focusses of the Freudian theories positing that dreaming allows access to the unconscious functions of the mind in neurosis treatment (Freud, 1953)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,6,Aserinsky and Kleitman (1953) observed specific intervals with rapid and recurrent eye movement and bursts of alpha activity comparable to those that occur during wakefulness.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,7,"The enthusiasm linked to the discovery of REM sleep considerably influenced dreaming research in several ways, and the neuroscientific study of dreaming is relatively recent."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,8,"Several studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological bases of dream experi- ence through a neuropsychological approach (Solms, 1997, 2000), neuroimaging (Maquet et al., 1996) and electrophysiological tech- niques (Marzano et al., 2011; Siclari et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,9,"Although several studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of specific brain mechanisms predicting dream recall (e.g., Siclari et al., 2017), many questions are still at the centre of the debate."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,10,The present paper summarises the main open issues concerning the neuroscientific study of dream experience.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,11,"Specifically, the review offers an overview about (a) the question related to the REM-non- REM (NREM) sleep dichotomy, (b) the state-trait-like problem, (c) the relationship between waking and dreaming state and the manipulation of dreaming, (d) the issue concerning the access to dream experience, (e) the role of nightmares, and (f) the debate on dreamwork in  psychotherapy."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,12,1.1.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,13,"| The REM-NREM sleep dichotomy  Acclassical view of the neurobiological basis of the oneiric activity pos- tulates the existence of a close relationship between dream experi- ence and REM sleep (Hobson et al., 2000; Nielsen, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,14,"This hypothesis was based on early electroencephalographic (EEG) obser- vations showing that >70% of individuals awakened during REM sleep reported dreams, while dream recall at the awakening from other sleep stages was rare (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1955)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,15,"According to this view, the wake-like high-frequency EEG pattern characterising REM sleep would represent the ideal electrophysiological scenario for the occurrence of dream experiences, while the slow-frequency activity characterising NREM sleep would be associated with the absence of  oneiric activity."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,16,"However, using different criteria to collect dream  reports, several studies found that successful recall of a conscious experience can be frequently observed also after NREM awakenings, and in a minority of cases no dream experience was reported after REM awakenings (Foulkes, 1962; Nielsen, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,17,"Moreover, dream recall is still possible after lesions in brain regions involved in REM sleep generation, while the total disappearance of dream recall can be observed after focal forebrain lesions without an impact on REM sleep (Solms, 2000)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,18,"Also, dream experience is preserved after pharmacolog- ical suppression of REM sleep (Landolt et al., 2001; Oudiette et al., 2012)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,19,"Finally, dream recall has been recently associated with a similar electrophysiological response after REM and NREM sleep (D'Atri et al., 2019; Siclari et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,20,"These results suggest that (a) dream and REM sleep are controlled by distinct brain mechanisms, (b) the postulate of a clear distinction between presence and absence of dreaming respectively in REM and NREM has not a solid support, and therefore (c) dreams can occur in any sleep stage."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,21,A dichotomy between NREM and REM sleep has been also hypo- thesised for the qualitative aspects of dreams.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,22,"Indeed, it has been pro- posed that REM and NREM sleep exhibit different kinds of mental activity."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,23,"According to this view, REM sleep is characterised by an emotional, vivid, and bizarre “dream-like” mentation (Antrobus, 1983; Casagrande et al., 1996; Foulkes, 1967; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983; Waterman et al., 1993), while NREM mental activity would be “thought-like”, with reduced emotional load, greater fragmentation, and contents more similar to waking thoughts (Foulkes, 1967; Rechtschaffen et al., 1963)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,24,"Nevertheless, the existence of a clear-cut REM-NREM dichotomy has been questioned also in this case based on several findings: (a) “dream-like” reports have been observed also after NREM sleep (Monroe et al., 1965; Solms, 2000; Zimmerman, 1970) and (b) the qualitative differences between REM and NREM dream reports disappear when their length is equated (Antrobus, 1983; Cavallero et al., 1992; Foulkes & Schmidt, 1983)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,25,"In light of these observations, the assumption that the presence/ absence and the phenomenological aspects of dream experiences strictly depend on the sleep stage per se is simplistic."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,26,"It is worth not- ing that a precise definition of the time-coupling between the sleep stages and the actual occurrence of dream experience is difficult, as the access to sleep mentation is possible only in an indirect way through dream reports after the awakening (see the paragraph “What about direct access to dream experience?”)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,27,"At the same time, the occurrence of dream experiences in both REM and NREM sleep, two physiological stages characterised by distinct electrophysiological and neurotransmitters patterns, appears paradoxical."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,1,28,"Such considerations raised the question of what mechanisms facilitate/inhibit the recall of a conscious experience at the awakening from different sleep stages, and what factors can explain intra- and inter-individual variability in  the phenomenology of the oneiric activity."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,2,"Interest in dreams (Bealulieu-Prevost & Zadra, 2007), visual imagery abilities (Cory & Ormiston, 1975), personality dimensions like openness to experience, absorption, psychological boundaries (Beaulieu-Prevost & Zadra, 2007), and predisposition to suppress neg- ative emotions and thoughts (Malinowski, 2015) appear related to individual differences in the oneiric activity."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,3,"Crucially, neuroimaging studies provided evidence about the rela- tionship between dream features and stable brain anatomical and functional characteristics."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,4,"Qualitative facets of dreams have been associated with volumetric and structural measures of the amygdala- hippocampus complex in healthy subjects (De Gennaro et al., 2011) and amygdala volume, dorsomedial prefrontal cortical thickness, and dopaminergic activity in patients with Parkinson's disease (De Gennaro et al., 2016)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,5,"Moreover, compared to low dream recallers, high dream recallers showed (a) greater medial prefrontal cortex white-matter density (Vallat et al., 2018); (b) higher regional cerebral blood flow in the temporo-parietal junction during wakeful- ness, Stage 3, and REM sleep and in medial prefrontal cortex during wakefulness and REM sleep (Eichenlaub et al., 2014a); (c) enhanced functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and between areas of the DMN and memory-related regions immediately after the awakening (Vallat et al., 2020); and (d) larger event-related potentials to distracting sounds even during active listening, arguing for enhanced bottom-up processing of irrelevant sounds but also an enhanced recruitment of top-down attention as suggested by larger contingent negative variation during target expectancy and P3b to target sounds (Ruby et al., 2021)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,6,"Taken together, these findings high- light that stable individual features of the brain structure and activa- tion patterns can explain inter-individual differences in dream experience."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,7,"Beyond the influence of trait-like factors, a growing number of studies also point to the role of the physiological milieu associated with the oneiric experience (state-like factors)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,8,"In other words, the specific regional features of the physiological background contingent with dreaming would facilitate or prevent dream recall, potentially explaining intra-individual differences in dream reports."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,9,This possibil- ity has been investigated mainly by assessing the sleep EEG pattern preceding dream recall.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,10,"In this way, several studies found that a suc- cessful dream recall was associated with greater frontal theta oscilla- tions before the awakening from REM sleep (Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015; Scarpelli et al., 2019b) and reduced parieto- occipital alpha activity before the awakening from NREM sleep (Esposito et al., 2004; Marzano et al., 2011)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,11,"As theta and alpha oscil- lations are associated with memory processes during wakefulness (Hsieh & Ranganath, 2014), these results suggest that wakefulness and sleep share the same neurobiological mechanisms for the elabora- tion of episodic memories (see the next paragraph)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,12,"On the other hand, a growing number of within-subject investiga- tions (which allows overcoming the possible influence of stable trait- like factors) show that a more desynchronised EEG pattern is associ- ated with dream recall in both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari  et al., 2017; D'Atri et al."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,13,"2019; Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; but see Wong et al., 2020)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,14,"In particular, dream experi- ence would be facilitated by a pattern of reduced slow-wave activity (SWA), most steadily in posterior regions (Siclari et al., 2017, 2018)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,15,"Interestingly, lucid dreams, phenomenon characterised by conscious awareness during the oneiric experience, appear associated with greater EEG gamma activity (Baird et al., 2022; Voss et al., 2009)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,16,"Fur- thermore, a transcranial current stimulation delivered in a lower gamma range during REM sleep can affect the ongoing electrophysio- logical activity and increase self-reflective awareness in dreams (Voss et al., 2014)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,17,"These observations are consistent with “activation” the- oretical models (Antrobus, 1991; Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Koulack & Goodenough, 1976), which postulate that dream recall would be facilitated by a greater level of arousal during sleep, repre- sented at an electrophysiological level by higher brain activation."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,18,"Indeed, the frequency of dream recall increases in association with a sleep pattern characterised by greater sleep fragmentation (van Wyk et al., 2019), faster spindles, especially in central and posterior cor- tical areas (Siclari et al., 2018), intra-sleep wakefulness (De Gennaro et al., 2010; Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Vallat et al., 2017), and sleep arousal (Polini et al., 2017; Schredl, 2009)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,19,"Furthermore, a night of recovery sleep after a period of prolonged wakefulness, usually characterised by reduced awakenings, almost totally abolished dream recall after the final morning awakening (De Gennaro et al., 2010)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,20,"The SWA represents a marker of sleep intensity (Borbély & Achermann, 1999), likely subserving the fading of consciousness during sleep."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,21,"Thus, the pattern of local SWA reduction in association with dreaming activity may represent the electrophysiological marker of the greater arousal level needed for a successful dream recall."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,22,"Moreover, this evidence provides a reli- able explanation for the apparently paradoxical occurrence of dreams in states of consciousness (i.e, REM and NREM sleep) characterised by drastically different EEG patterns."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,23,"Overall, these findings highlight the crucial role of the physiologi- cal state preceding dream recall."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,24,"However, several questions remain open."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,25,"First, the influence of circadian and homeostatic factors on the oneiric experience and its electrophysiological pattern is not clear (Chellappa et al., 2011; D'Atri et al., 2019; Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,2,26,"Moreover, the impact of the regional distribu- tion of SWA on qualitative dream facets needs to be fully investi- gated, as empirical preliminary evidence has been provided only by Siclari et al."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,1,original concept has gone through several re-interpretations and adjustments since then.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,2,"Early cognitively-oriented studies focussed on the continuity between dream contents and waking events, personal concerns, thoughts, behaviours, and emotions, suggesting that waking-life expe- riences are reflected into subsequent dreams (Nielsen & Powell, 1992; Schredl, 2006; Blagrove, 2011; Vallat et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,3,"Compelling evi- dence also showed the key role of the personal and emotional salience in mediating the preferential incorporation of waking-life aspects during mental sleep activity (Malinowski & Horton, 2014)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,4,"Further, different time intervals between waking experiences and related dream contents could represent “day-residue effect” or “dream-lag effect” as a function of the elapsed period (ie, 1-2 days and 5-7 days, respectively) (Eichenlaub et al., 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,5,"Specifically, the delayed incorporation of waking life events (“dream-lag effect”) was selectively observed during REM sleep and for personally significant events (Van Rijn et al., 2015)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,6,A complementary field of study posits the continuity between waking state and mental sleep activity from a neurophysiological per- spective.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,7,"Namely, a growing body of evidence suggests that brain mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional functioning remain the same across different states of consciousness (e.g., Marzano et al., 2011; Eichenalub et al., 2018)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,8,"The involvement of alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (5-7 Hz) oscilla- tions in memory-related neural processes during wakefulness are well-established, especially as regards episodic-declarative memory (Klimesch, 1999)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,9,"In particular, the increase in the frontal theta activity and the alpha power decrease during the encoding phase of episodic memories were found to play a pivotal role in the subsequent recall of stored information (Hsieh & Ranganath, 2014; Klimesch, 1999)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,10,"Over the last two decades, several studies were conducted under the assumption that dream encoding and recall could represent a peculiar form of episodic memory (Fosse et al., 2003)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,11,"As previously mentioned, a successful dream recall has been linked to higher frontal theta activity during REM sleep (Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015) and lower alpha activity over the temporo-parietal region during NREM (Esposito et al., 2004; Marzano et al., 2011; Takeuchi et al., 2003)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,12,"Moreover, the topographical distribution of the above- mentioned frequency bands resembles brain regions involved in encoding and retrieval mechanisms during wakefulness."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,13,"A large body of experimental studies have also shown the conti- nuity between dreaming and emotional processing (for a review, see Scarpelli et al., 2019c)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,14,"First of all, as described in the previous para- graph, neuroimaging studies showed the relationship between qualita- tive and quantitative stable aspects of dream experience and structural parameters of limbic areas (De Gennaro et al., 2011)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,15,"Con- sistently, subjects reporting higher levels of fear in their dreams showed a concomitant higher activation of the medial prefrontal cor- tex, responsible for reduced activation of the amygdala, insula, and midcingulate cortex both during sleep and wakefulness (Phelps et al., 2004; Sterpenich et al., 2020)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,16,"Further, the main brain circuits involved in emotional processing during wake are highly activated during REM sleep, such as the limbic system (Nir & Tononi, 2010) and  reward system (Perogamvros & Schwartz, 2012)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,17,"Notably, a recent simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging study dem- onstrated the privileged re-emergence during sleep of patterns of brain activity associated with a recent rewarding (compared to a non- rewarding) waking experience during sleep (Sterpenich et al., 2021)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,18,"Starting from these findings, many researchers stated that dream activity might have a crucial role in processing emotional events expe- rienced during wakefulness (see Scarpelli et al., 2019c)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,19,"More in- depth, the theta (Nishida et al., 2009; Boyce et al., 2016; Sopp et al., 2018) and gamma activities (Van Der Helm et al., 2011) were identified as the EEG markers of emotional memory processing."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,20,"Selec- tive sleep deprivation protocols provided experimental evidence about the lack of emotional memories consolidation in the absence of REM sleep stage (Spoormaker et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2001), supporting the notion that dreaming represents the privileged sce- nario for the offline reprocessing of waking emotional stimuli."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,21,"Keeping in mind the unitary perspective across waking and sleep state, several investigations aimed to overcome the boundaries between different states of consciousness directly influencing sleep mentation by different kinds of sensory stimuli administered pre- or during sleep."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,22,Pre-sleep stimulation methods have been used since the very beginning of dream research.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,23,The pioneering study by Dement and Wolpert (1958) showed the relation between the 24-h fluid restriction in participants and their subsequent REM dream content.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,24,"Sensory stimulation through pre-sleep visual stimuli affected dream content by using stressful films (Goodenough et al., 1965) or visual inverting prisms (Corsi-Cabrera et al., 1986)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,25,"Concerning sensory stimulation delivered during REM or NREM sleep stages, early studies described the incorporation of meaning ver- bal stimuli (Berger, 1963; Hoelscher et al., 1981)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,26,"Also, somatosensory stimulation (e.g., water on the skin, thermal stimulation, pressure cuff, electrical pulses) (Baldridge et al., 1965; Dement & Wolpert, 1958; Koulack, 1969; Nielsen, 1993) or vestibular stimulation (Leslie & Ogilvie, 1996) were found to affect dream content."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,27,"As expected, these types of stimulation increased vividness and bodily sensation in the dream contents."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,28,"Recent studies using olfactory stimulation during sleep showed the influence on the emotional content of dreams as a function of the hedonic characteristic of stimuli (Schredl et al., 2009) and the reac- tivation of the odour-associated images (Schredl et al., 2014)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,3,29,"The strong effect of olfactory stimulation on dream emotional aspects is interpreted in terms of direct connections to the limbic system (Smith & Shepherd, 2003)."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,4,The issue concerning dream access is definitively the most complex to address.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,5,"Indeed, the real object of study in the abovementioned inves- tigations (e.g., Chellappa et al., 2011; Marzano et al., 2011; Scarpelli et al., 2015, 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Scarpelli et al., 2019b; Siclari et al., 2017) is “dream recall’ and not the dream experience itself."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,6,"In other words, dreaming is not directly observable, and researchers are able to obtain information about the oneiric activity just requiring a dream report to the individual when he is awake."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,7,"Also, we have already discussed that detecting the exact moment in which the dreams are produced during sleep is very difficult."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,8,"From a methodological point of view, three approaches to collect dreaming are well-known: (a) retrospective, (b) prospective, and (c) provoked awakenings with subsequent dream reports."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,9,"While the retrospective method allows researchers to collect dreaming through interviews or questionnaires in large samples quickly, the prospective protocol (i.e., dream diaries; longitudinal dream report collection) is less prone to memory biases (Robert & Zadra, 2008)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,10,"These two strat- egies allow classifying people in high and low recallers, helping to investigate the neurobiological trait-like features of dreamers (e.g., Eichenlaub et al., 2014b; Eichenlaub et al, 2014a; Ruby et al., 2021; van Wyk et al., 2019)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,11,"However, the most accurate approach is represented by the provoked awakenings associated with the polysomnography (PSG) of one or more sleep nights in a labora- tory."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,12,"Generally, participants are awakened to explore the presence of a dream report and to compare the recall and non-recall condition (Scarpelli et al., 2017; Scarpelli et al., 2020a; Siclari et al., 2017) or the report's qualitative features (Scarpelli et al., 2020b), correlating them with the specific EEG patterns preceding the awakening."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,13,"It is worth noting that the narration of dream contents could be influenced by many biases after awakenings, such as the experimental setting (Schredl, 2008), the physiological background of waking-life and by individual variables, such as personality, cognitive functions, censure/ omissions and socio-cultural features (Nir & Tononi, 2010), making dream reports not always completely reliable."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,14,How can we overcome this obstacle?
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,4,15,"In this regard, recent studies have suggested that viable access to mental sleep activity is represen- ted by dream-enacting behaviours (DEBs; Baltzan et al., 2020)."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,1,14.1 | Nightmares  Nightmares are disturbing mental sleep activity characterised by nega- tive emotions and often considered a clinical symptom causing signifi- cant distress.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,2,They are frequently associated with a high level of arousal and somatic manifestations that are capable to awake the dreamer from REM sleep.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,3,"The repeated occurrence of this event is categorised as parasomnia, i.e., “nightmare disorder”, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,4,"On the one hand, this disturbance is frequently related to post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Germain, 2013), but it could also be a reaction to stress conditions (Scarpelli et al., 2022)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,5,"On the other hand, also idiopathic nightmares, i.e., without a known cause, should be con- sidered."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,6,"For instance, this kind of mental sleep activity is quite com- mon in children tending to disappear during adulthood, and it is more frequent among females (Nielsen & Levin, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,7,"From a neurobiological perspective, a recent investigation shows that the activation of the autonomic nervous system may be linked to nightmares (Paul et al., 2019)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,8,"Some studies revealed REM-specific alterations in nightmare sufferers such as longer REM latency, increased skipping of early REM periods and cycle length, and more frequent REM periods (Nielsen et al., 2010)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,9,"Furthermore, some EEG findings highlighted the presence of slow frontal and central theta activity during REM sleep in a group of nightmare recallers (Marquis et al, 2017)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,10,"Further studies reported evidence for reduced slow- wave sleep and greater intra-sleep wakefulness (Simor et al., 2012), increased alpha power during REM sleep, and higher levels of EEG desynchronisation in NREM sleep of students with frequent night- mares (Simor et al., 2013)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,11,"In other words, as already mentioned for dream recall, a higher autonomic and electrophysiological activation may provide the physiological background to the nightmare occur- rence (Fisher et al., 1970; Nielsen & Zadra, 2005)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,12,This is consistent with the self-reported experience of greater emotional and physical activations during the nightmare occurrence.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,13,"Fear is the predominant emotion included in nightmares (Zadra et al., 2006), suggesting that nightmares could be linked to fear- dysfunction disturbances, i.e., phobias, generalised or social anxiety (Nielsen & Levin, 2007; Walker, 2010)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,14,"In other words, nightmares could be related to the dysfunction in the hippocampal-amygdala pre- frontal system that controls fear memory formation and extinction (Marquis et al., 2017; Nielsen & Levin, 2007)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,15,"Nevertheless, the func- tional role of nightmares is still debated."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,16,"Considering the early theo- ries of dream function emphasising roles for REM sleep and dreaming in promoting adaptation to stress, nightmares could be interpreted as a failure of this process (Wright & Koulack, 1987)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,17,"Along this vein, some authors proposed that a certain degree of awareness of our dream contents and the possibility of altering them may be beneficial for nightmares sufferers (Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001; Neidhardt et al., 1992)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,18,"In particular, compelling evidence highlighted that imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is very effective in reducing chronic nightmares within 6-12 weeks of ther- apy (Germain et al., 2004; Kellner et al., 1992; Krakow et al., 2001;  Neidhardt et al., 1992)."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,22,"It has been hypothesised that lucid dreaming could be a sort of coping strategy to face unpleasant stimuli during a dream experience (Schiappa et al., 2018)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,23,"Actually, lucid dream therapy is a cognitive technique that allows patients to learn to be aware of and modify their mental sleep activity during their nightmares through daily exercises (Spoormaker & Van Den Bout, 2006; Zadra & Pihl, 1997)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,24,"More recently, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro, 1989) has been employed for nightmares treatment in PTSD."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,25,"Starting from the view that nightmares are the manifesta- tions of adverse events registered in a dysfunctional form, this tech- nique aimed to promote the recall of distressing images while activating one type of bilateral sensory input (e.g., hand tapping or side-to-side eye movement)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,26,The protocol allows subjects to identify and reprocess the targeted disturbing memories and experiences in order to formulate insight and adaptive behaviour.
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,5,27,"In conclusion, it should be underlined that studies on PSG abnor- malities and specific macro- and micro-structural features correlated to nightmares are still missing."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,3,"Although several authors underline a “marginalisation” of dream in modern clinical psychological practice (Leonard & Dawson, 2018), it is worth noting that dreams have become an object of study also in clinical paradigms different from the psychoanalytical models (Pesant & Zadra, 2004; Velotti & Zavattini, 2019)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,4,"Among the others, the evolution of the debate about dreaming in the cognitivist frame- work (Rosner et al., 2004) represents an interesting example of the redefinition of dreamwork in psychotherapy based on novel experi- mental data, theoretical models, and clinical observations."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,5,"Beck (1971) proposed that dreams reflect the individual conception (and biases) about the self, the world, and the future, and may represent and indi- cator of changes in the emotional status."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,9,"From a rationalist perspective, starting from the hypothe- sis that dreams are subjected to the same cognitive distortions that characterise the waking experience, it has been proposed that dreamwork can help to detect cognitive biases and maladaptive thought patterns (Barrett, 2002; Freeman & White, 2002; Hill, 1996, 2003) and promote cognitive reconstructing."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,10,"On the other hand, the constructivist paradigm moved the focus on the narrative facets of dreams and the co-construction of meaning between patient and therapist (Bara, 2012; Rezzonico & Bani, 2015; Rosner et al., 2004), with the aim to promote the emergence of relevant aspects of the personal meaning and increase the level of awareness of the patient."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,11,"The interest in the clinical use of dreams led to the development of different articulated models of dreamwork in psychotherapy, like the Description, Memory Sources, and Reformulation (DMR) model (Montangero, 2009) and the cognitive-experiential model (Hill, 1996, 2003)."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,12,"Overall, Eudell-Simmons and Hilsenroth (2005) identify four main functions of dreams in psychotherapy: (a) facilitate the therapeu- tic process, (b) increase patient insight and self-awareness, (c) provide clinical information relevant for the therapist, and (d) provide a mea- sure of therapeutic change."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,13,"Clearly, a further research effort is needed to provide support for the objective and efficacy of dreamwork in psychotherapy."
What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,14,"Neverthe- less, the ongoing debate on this topic has led to several models of the clinical valence of dreams that appear consistent with experimental findings on oneiric activity, mainly moving from standardised symbolic interpretations of dreams to approaches based on the relationship of dreaming with individual experience and cognitive/emotional/behav-  ioural functioning."

What about dreams  State of the art and open questions,6,17,"Overall, we believe that (a) some results are still heterogeneous due to the application of different protocols, so a more consistent approach is needed; (b) the use of advanced techniques such as high-density EEG or source localisation methods should be encour- aged to better understand the relationship between specific oscilla- tions and dream features; (c) further studies on experimental manipulation of dreaming should be carried out, also considering the implementation of brain stimulation techniques to promote dream recall or its specific characteristics; and (d) DEBs could be used as a model to observe dream contents overcoming the problem regarding the correspondence between specific time/stage of sleep and dream production, offering new insights about the neural correlate of dreaming."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,2,Recent studies suggest that treatment of insom-  nia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global  burden of mental disorders.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,3,"KEYWORDS  anxiety, CBT-I, depression, insomnia, insomnia models, prevention, treatment guidelines  1 | DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA DISORDER (ID)—DSM-5, ICSD-3, ICD-11  In the last 50 years all medical diagnostic classification systems have included ID."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,4,"DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association) in its previous versions DSM-III-R/DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1987, 1998) suggested a distinc- tion between primary and secondary insomnias, whereas DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) heralded a paradigmatic change by establishing ID as an overarching diagnostic category, elimi- nating artificial distinctions."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,5,"The ICSD (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) in its third version (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014) confirmed this new nosology (see Table 1; diagnostic criteria for chronic ID according to ICSD-3)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,6,"The ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition; World Health Organization, 1993) distinguished between organic and non-organic sleep disorders; however, ICD-11 will follow the avenue paved by DSM-5 and ICSD-3 (World Health Organization, 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,7,"When analysing the “new” criteria for ID all systems list both night-time and daytime symptoms and, notably, the symptom of non-restorative sleep was dropped from the criteria due to lack of specificity."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,8,"Abandoning the distinction between primary/secondary insomnia constituted a major advance in acknowledging that insomnia fre- quently is not just a symptom of any other somatic or mental disorder, but constitutes an independent disorder, deserving specific consider- ation in clinical practice."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,9,"It is important to note that insomnia probably more frequently occurs as a co-morbid condition together with somatic and mental disorders, than it does occur in its isolated form."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,10,"DSM-5, ICSD-3 and ICD-11 pay respect to this by explicitly allowing co-morbidity."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,11,"Furthermore, it turned out that cognitive-behavioural treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) not only has decisive effects on sleep/ insomnia complaints, but also positively influences somatic/mental co-morbidities and quality of life."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,12,"At present, evidence is accumulating that insomnia treatment with CBT-I may even have surplus benefits with respect to general treatment and prevention especially of mental disorders (Benz et al., 2020; Cheng et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,13,"2019; Hertenstein et al., 2022; Irwin et al., 2022; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,14,"Nevertheless, ID as a “one size fits all” category is seen critical by many working in the field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,1,15,"There is still a lively and ongoing discussion about different insomnia phenotypes, for example focussing on the main nocturnal complaint, that is, insomnia with or without “objec-  tive” short sleep (Vgontzas et al., 2013), or sleep-onset insomnia  versus sleep-maintenance insomnia (Pillai et al., 2015)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,1,"concerning diagnostic procedures, however, should be highlighted here."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,2,The use of sleep diaries constitutes an integral part of insomnia assessment for both research and/or clinical purposes (e.g.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,3,"consensus sleep diary by Carney et al., 2012)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,4,Sleep diaries are easy to apply and to evaluate.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,5,"Sleep diaries focus on the experience of sleep and can be reviewed by the clinician as they are presented, but the inherent information can also be used to create highly informative graphical displays of sleep and bedtimes (Figure 1)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,6,"Beyond sleep diaries, other insomnia-specific questionnaires like the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien et al., 2001) or the Sleep Condi- tion Indicator (Espie et al., 2014) should be used."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,7,"For both clinical and fundamental research, it is favourable to take note of the recommendations for a standard research assessment of insomnia (Buysse et al., 2006)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,8,"Several paradigms were developed to elucidate specific aspects of insomnia, for example, the attentional bias paradigm (Espie et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,9,This paradigm suggests that patients with chronic insomnia have developed a bias in their perception and processing of stimuli related to insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,10,"Other highly promising paradigms investigate failing overnight amelioration of distress, which seems key to persistence of hyperarousal (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,11,"At present, not yet being ready for standard clinical practice, it is conceivable that these paradigms might be used in the future to measure responsiveness to CBT-I, also in combination with neuroimaging methods."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,12,"As the diagnosis of insomnia is solely based on subjective com- plaints and their measurement, it remains a matter of long-standing debate what the role of technical methods like actigraphy or poly- somnography (PSG) might be."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,13,It is a highly controversial issue as to whether PSG should be part of the diagnostic process.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,14,"Doubtlessly PSG helps to unravel suspected occult pathology of sleep, that is, peri- odic limb movements during sleep (periodic limb movement disorder) or sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,15,"US guidelines clearly deny the usefulness of PSG to diagnose insomnia (Kushida et al., 2005), whereas guidelines of the German and the European Sleep Research Society (Riemann, Baum, et al., 2017; Riemann, Baglioni, et al., 2017) suggest that PSG be used for patients with therapy-refractory insomnia who have not responded to a previous adequate “dose” of pharmaco- or psychotherapy."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,16,The frequently described discrepancy between subjective (i.e.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,17,data from sleep diaries) and objective data (PSG) called paradoxi- cal insomnia or sleep state misperception is seen as a major clinical and scientific challenge.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,18,"PSG contrasted with subjective data does not reveal as pronounced disturbances of sleep as indicated by subjective data (Feige et al., 2008)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,19,"A PSG meta-analysis revealed mean total sleep time differences between insomnia and good sleepers of about 25 min, whereas subjective estimates demonstrated an almost 2-hr difference (Baglioni, Regen, et al., 2014; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,20,Traditional PSG reveals only a glimpse of the brain activ- ity during sleep.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,21,"Advanced analyses have commenced to reveal elec- troencephalogram (EEG) correlates of subjective wakefulness during sleep, like simultaneous wake-like and sleep-like brain activity in peo- ple with insomnia (Christensen et al., 2019; Stephan et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,22,"Furthermore, classification of individual insomnia patients based on their PSG and EEG power-spectral variables can distinguish between those with objective short sleep and those with sleep state mis- perception (Kao et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,23,"Accordingly, the “misperception” may in fact be “mismeasurement”: an inappropriate use or interpretation of traditional PSG features by clinicians, rather than inappropriate inter- pretation of subjective experiences by people with insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,24,It is important to bear in mind that these same challenges apply to mental disorders in general.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,25,"There is no objective “test” for depression, anxi- ety or psychosis."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,26,"The validation of any such tests needs to apply self- report coupled with clinical judgement as the “gold-standard.” Vgontzas and colleagues have postulated that the long-term health consequences of insomnia may be related specifically to objec- tive short sleep duration of less than 6 hr (Vgontzas et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,27,"However, patients with short sleep insomnia during one night do not fulfil that criteria on another night, and an increased risk of hyperten- sion in short sleeping insomnia could not be replicated (Johann et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,28,"Also, the hypothesis that the presence of objectively documented short sleep may be of relevance for the choice of therapy (Riemann et al., 2011), that is, pharmacotherapy for insomnia patients with objective short sleep duration versus psychotherapy for insomnia patients with objective normal sleep duration, has yet to be resolved and deserves further consideration (Vgontzas et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,29,More details will be provided in the aetiology/pathophysiology section.

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,31,"2 | EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INSOMNIA AND INSOMNIA AS A RISK FACTOR FOR OTHER DISORDERS  Insomnia more frequently afflicts females than males (60% versus 40%), and its prevalence increases with age (for an overview, see Ohayon, 2002)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,32,"The European Academy for CBT-I has summarized prevalence data for ID across some European countries (Baglioni et al., 2020), varying strongly from country to country."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,33,"Data for Germany indicate a prevalence of 5.7%, whereas French surveys indi- cate figures up to 20%."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,34,"On average, approximately 10% of the adult European population suffer from chronic insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,35,The heterogenous data clearly stress the need for the prospective collection of pan-European samples with state-of-the-art methods to obtain the full picture for planning of insomnia healthcare services.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,36,The costs of insomnia for the individual and society are stagger- ing: it was demonstrated that insomnia conveys increased risks for cardiovascular diseases (Li et al.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,2,37,"2014), obesity and diabetes (Anothaisintawee et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2018), depression (Baglioni et al, 2011; Hertenstein et al, 2019), anxiety (Hertenstein et al., 2019) and suicide (Pigeon et al., 2012)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,9,"Current theoretical approaches span from cognitive-behavioural to neurobiological models, and models taking into account both levels simultaneously."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,10,"The basic structure of the model depicted in Figure 3 is taken from the so-called 3P model of insomnia (Spielman et al., 1987)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,11,"The 3Ps signify: predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,12,“Predisposing” factors come from the areas of (epi-)genetics and early life stress that contribute to individual differences at the level of brain function and personality.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,13,"Genetic and epigenetic factors have been shown to be involved in the aetiology of insomnia by family and twin studies (for an overview, see Palagini et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,14,"Genome-wide association studies point to an involvement of a very large number of genes, each with a very small contribution, and shared genetic factors for insomnia and restless legs, cardiometabolic, and especially psychiat- ric traits Jansen et al., 2019; Lane et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,15,"Interestingly, the brain tissues and cell types expressing sets of insomnia risk genes are not pri- marily part of the known circuitry regulating sleep but are rather part of circuitries involved in emotion regulation (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,16,"Still, for completeness, a discussion on the development and maintenance of insomnia should include the neurobiological mecha- nisms of sleep, notably homeostatic and biological time-keeping mechanisms (Borbély, 1982)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,17,"The flip-flop switch model of sleep regu- lation (Saper et al., 2005) suggests a bistable switch mechanism between sleep and wake promoting centres of neuronal cell groups."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,18,"Wakefulness is governed by a network of cell populations in the hypothalamus (including orexinergic neurons), basal forebrain and brain stem, activating thalamus and cortical structures."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,19,These struc-  tures include and extend beyond the cell groups in the reticular  formation of the brainstem (originally described as ascending reticular activating system).
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,20,"The main sleep-inducing centres are located in the ventrolateral-preoptic nucleus (VLPO), which becomes active during sleep and inhibits all major wake-promoting centres in the hypothala- mus and brain stem, with the neurotransmitters galanin and gamma- aminobutyric acid."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,21,"The VLPO receives afferent input from each of the major monoaminergic systems, and is inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,22,"A mutual inhibitory circuit between both systems, the wake and the sleep system, leads to a flip-flop switch with “sharp” transi- tions between sleeping and waking."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,23,"Thus, insomnia on this level can be conceptualized as imbalance between sleep-inducing and wake (i.e."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,24,arousal)-inducing mechanisms.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,25,A hyperactivity of the arousal sys- tem or a hypoactivity of the sleep system or both simultaneously could thus “drive” the insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,26,"Circadian and homeostatic mecha- nisms are also involved in this switch process, and it has been specu- lated that a dysfunctional “key switch” (see above) could play a role in the pathogenesis of insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,27,"According to the two-process model of sleep regulation (Borbély, 1982), sleep-wake behaviour is governed by circadian time-keeping mechanisms and a homeostatically con- trolled process S, representing the sleep drive."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,30,"Indeed, the main effective component of CBT-I, sleep restriction, is hypothesized to act on the sleep drive (Maurer et al., 2018), and long- term effectiveness of CBT-I improves with the addition of circadian interventions (Dekker et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,31,"Notwith- standing these effects, decades of research in insomnia have failed to reveal circadian and homeostatic mechanisms as primary factors involved the origin and pathophysiology of the majority of people suf- fering from ID (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,32,"One might conclude that enhancement of homeostatic sleep pressure and support of circadian rhythm amplitude alleviates insomnia, but that we may have to look beyond hourglass and clock to find underlying causes predisposing to insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,33,"A third factor involved in sleep and predisposing to insomnia is emotion (Saper et al., 2005)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,34,"This factor is frequently overlooked, in spite of the ubiquitous experience that sleep initiation is difficult under threatening conditions—no matter what our hourglass and clock suggest."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,36,"An increasing number of observations suggests a key role of this third factor in the origin and pathophysiol- ogy of the predisposition to insomnia (for review, see Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,37,"For example, the trait to exhibit a pronounced dis- turbed sleep response to stressful events has been shown to be a major risk factor for insomnia (Drake et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,38,"Also other personal- ity traits related to emotion regulation have been linked to insomnia, including neuroticism, perfectionism, sensitivity to anxiety symptoms, and the tendency to internalize problems (Dekker et al., 2017; van de Laar et al., 2010)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,4,39,"The major early developmental factors predisposing to insomnia involve emotion as well: risk genes seem to have a prefer- ence for brain circuitries involved in emotion regulation, and early childhood adversity likewise affects these circuitries (Van Someren, 2021)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,7,"“Perpetuating” factors can be discussed with respect to hyper- arousal, which can be conceptualized as overactivity of the arousal- promoting systems, out of balance with the activity in sleep-inducing systems."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,8,"Hyperarousal includes physiological, cognitive and emotional components, and has been considered a stable characteristic of peo- ple with insomnia both during the night and during the day (Morin et al., 2015; Riemann et al., 2010, 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,9,"It has been demonstrated that patients with insomnia show increased levels of autonomic activ- ity (though the issue is discussed critically with respect to heart rate variability; Dodds et al., 2017) and an overactivity of the HPA-axis, as documented by increased levels of cortisol output during day- and  night-time (see meta-analysis by Dressle et al., 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,10,"Central nervous  system (CNS) indicators of hyperarousal in people with insomnia are increased amounts of micro-arousals and increases in fast EEG fre- quencies (in the sigma and beta bands) during sleep (Christensen et al., 2019; Feige et al., 2013; Perlis et al., 1997, 2001; Spiegelhalder et al., 2012), and also wake EEG shows signatures of increased excita- tion (Colombo, Ramautar, et al., 2016; Colombo, Wei, et al., 2016) and somatic awareness and responsivity (Wei et al., 2016; Wei, Blanken, & Van Someren, 2018; Wei, Ramautar, et al., 2018)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,5,12,"2018), the rapidly increasing number of neuroimaging studies on insomnia (Riemann et al., 2015) suggests an overactivity of cortico-limbic net- works relative to sleep-promoting neuronal networks."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,3,(2021) used an event-related potentials paradigm to demonstrate that ID patients differed from good sleepers by showing reduced P2 amplitudes only in phasic REM sleep.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,4,These studies highlight a special role of REM sleep for insomnia.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,5,"The mechanisms underlying this special role of REM sleep in the predisposition, perpetuation and psychiatric consequences were addressed in a series of seminal studies (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019; Wassing, Schalkwijk, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,6,"In brief, Wassing et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,7,showed that the restless REM sleep that is characteristic of people with insomnia interferes with overnight adaptation in limbic circuits of the brain.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,8,"The consequential difficulties with dissolving of distress could be key to the development and perpetuation of hyperarousal as well to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, as supported by other studies (Halonen et al., 2021; Pesonen et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,9,"Restless sleep lacks the prolonged silencing of the locus coeruleus and consequential drop in cerebral noradrenaline that characterizes normal restful REM sleep (Kjearby et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,10,"Because REM sleep is a period of pronounced limbic reactivation of emotional memory traces, it has been hypothe- sized that the increased level of noradrenaline during restless REM sleep interferes with the synaptic plasticity processes underlying adaptation of the neuronal engrams that represent distress, and could even result in sensitization, indicating maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,11,"Others have proposed that the low level of nor- adrenaline during REM sleep is key to restore the noradrenergic tone, to enable a low tonic and high phasic locus coeruleus activity during wakefulness (Goldstein & Walker, 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,12,"Restless REM sleep thus has a specific contribution to “emo- tional” perpetuating factors, and may explain why patients with insomnia are so prone to develop anxiety and depressive disorders in the long run."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,13,"Indeed, sleep has been conceptualized as a basic psycho- physiological process that is fundamental for stress, behaviour and emotion regulation (Hagger, 2010; Palmer & Alfano, 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,14,"Consis- tently, most mental disorders are associated with sleep impairment (Baglioni et al., 2016), and insomnia-related problems in children have been linked with difficulties in socio-emotional development (Sadeh et al., 2014; Vermeulen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,15,"In adults, insomnia has been found to be a predictor of years-long lingering of emotional distress (Wassing et al., 2016; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al., 2019), of depres- sion, and of anxiety disorders (Baglioni et al., 2011; Hertenstein et al., 2019; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,16,"Experimental studies have shown that patients with insomnia report more negative emotions than good sleepers (McCrae et al., 2008; Scott & Judge, 2006)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,17,"Psychophysiolog- ical studies have also evidenced an emotional bias in people with insomnia to sleep-related stimuli with negative valence compared with good sleepers (Baglioni et al., 2010; Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,18,"Perpetuating factors also include inadequate “behaviours”, like prolonged bedtimes, irregular sleep-wake schedules, napping during the day and other maladaptive behaviours, such as using alcohol to  combat insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,19,"Usually, these strategies are attempted to  compensate for lost sleep; however, in the end insomnia is maintained and exacerbated by decreasing sleep drive."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,20,"In addition, “cognitive perpetuating factors” have been identified, such as beliefs, worry and attentional bias (Espie, 2002; Harvey, 2002; Morin et al., 2007)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,21,These cognitions include unrealistic beliefs about sleep requirements and excessive worry for not meeting these stan- dards.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,22,"In recent years, the literature has emphasized the role of selec- tive attention processes in people with insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,23,"Specifically, it has been argued that the attentional system of patients with insomnia may be abnormally sensitive to sleep-related information (Harris et al., 2015)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,24,"It has been hypothesized that such attention bias may exacerbate sleep-related rumination and lead to sleep effort (Espie et al., 2006; Harvey, 2002)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,25,"Summarizing, acute precipitating life events can “set the wheels in motion’—acute insomnia is triggered."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,26,"The question of why most individuals who develop acute insomnia do not go on to develop the chronic condition has not yet been clarified (Ellis et al., 2012)—but likely involves genetic and early life stress-induced neurobiological vulnerability to keep “the train rolling.” A complex network of associ- ated symptoms including cognitive-, emotional- and cerebral hyper- arousal, unstable REM sleep and maladaptive behaviours will keep the furnace burning."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,27,"Sleep-preventing learned associations (conditioning effects) are strongly involved in this process as well, giving credit to Bootzin's assumption that in insomnia the original connection between the bed (stimulus) and the behaviour of sleep (response) has been lost or “unlearned” (Bootzin et al., 1991)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,6,28,"The CBT-I (see below) mainly targets the perpetuating factors, for example, relaxation techniques and mindfulness aim to address psy- chophysiological hyperarousal; sleep hygiene, stimulus control and sleep restriction try to correct maladaptive behaviours and enhance sleep drive; whereas cognitive strategies aim to alter “racing thoughts”, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and to reduce nocturnal  worrying and ruminations."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,3,The CBT-I comprises a family of interventions and is not “one” homogenous therapeutic strategy per se (Table 2).
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,4,"The CBT-I is in essence a multicomponent approach, comprising cognitive and behavioural parts, within each of which domain there is a wide range of treatment options."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,5,The principal behavioural therapies are sleep restriction and stimulus control.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,6,"Cognitive techniques include reappraisal, cognitive control and paradoxical intention."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,7,"There is also a range of relaxation therapies, and sleep hygiene education, although not effective as a standalone treatment, is commonly part of the CBT-I toolkit."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,8,A brief description of these techniques is given in the table.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,9,"For further details, the interested reader is referred to a new CBT-I textbook that will be published in 2022 (Baglioni et al., 2022)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,11,"Logically therefore CBT-I is not “a treatment” but is “a system of cognitive and behavioural therapeutics”, akin to pharmacotherapy (which is not a drug treatment but a “pharmaceutical approach” to clinical care; Espie, 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,12,"The history of evidence-based psychother- apy (in most disorders) reveals a period of time during which there was a tendency towards “lumping” of therapeutic elements, rather than the creation of precision techniques that “may” be used in com- bination."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,13,"This is certainly true of the non-pharmacological manage- ment of insomnia, and the term CBT-I has for the past 20 years or more been used rather generically in the literature because the major- ity of studies have deployed a CBT-I package."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,14,In earlier times there was a focus upon more specific interven- tions.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,15,"For example, comparing the effectiveness of abbreviated pro- gressive relaxation, stimulus control therapy and paradoxical intention (Espie et al., 1989), or even investigating components of a single ther- apy (Woolfolk & McNulty, 1983: compared progressive relaxation, progressive relaxation without tension release, imagery with tension release, and imagery without tension release)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,16,"Interestingly, of late, there has been renewed interest in single-component therapies."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,17,"We now find ourselves unpicking or deconstructing CBT to evaluate its active component treatments, and even its active treatment ingredi- ents."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,18,"The best example is sleep restriction therapy (SRT), widely reg- arded to be the most effective element of CBT (Edinger et al., 2021a; Maurer, Schneider et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,19,"A series of laboratory-based experi- ments has recently explored the homeostatic, arousal and circadian mechanisms of sleep restriction (Maurer et al., 2020, 2022; Maurer, Ftouni et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,20,In support of this is the fact that CBT protocols are effective even when they vary.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,21,"The AASM practice parameters task force recently grappled with the question, what are the “minimal characteristics” of effective CBT (Edinger et al., 2021a)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,22,"They concluded that “all studies included SRT, stimulus control and some form of cognitive therapy”; however, the cognitive component varied widely."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,23,Whether or not  relaxation strategies or sleep hygiene were included in the CBT-I  regimen varied across studies as well.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,24,"It was beyond the scope of this (group) to recommend a specific CBT protocol, and “these variations did not appear to systematically impact the effectiveness of the treat- ment” (p. 261)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,25,"This evidences the versatility and robustness of what is sometimes now referred to as CBTx (cognitive and behavioural therapeutics), that is, a “therapeutic formulary”, where not everyone needs the same content, or the same order of content (Espie, 2022)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,26,"Analysis of how SRT is configured suggests there is gross variability between studies and protocols (Kyle et al., 2015); it would be prudent to establish what is the most effective combination of SRT parame- ters, including tailoring to presenting insomnia phenotype."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,27,"Indeed, the widespread development of “precision medicine” (Ginsburg & Willard, 2009; Jain, 2002) has spawned interest in how “personalized behavioural sleep medicine” for insomnia may evolve in the future (Kyle et al., 2014)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,28,"Despite the impressive evidence base for CBT-l, its recognition internationally as the treatment of first choice for the management of insomnia and the fact that the CBTx formulary of treatments is quite wide ranging, in practice the majority of insomnia patients seeking medical help continue to receive medication."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,29,The issue here is not so much overprescribing of drugs as it is under-provision of CBT-I.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,30,Two innovations have been developed to address this problem.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,31,"The first, at the level of the treatment itself there has been growing interest in, and a rapidly accelerating evidence base for digital CBT-I, that is CBT-I delivered by fully automated web and mobile means."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,32,"The sec- ond, at the level of the service, has been the development of the “stepped care” model of insomnia service delivery."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,33,"The effectiveness of digital CBT-I has been robustly and rigor- ously demonstrated against psychological placebo (Espie et al., 2012), attention control (Christensen et al., 2016; Kaldo et al., 2015), sleep hygiene (Espie et al., 2019; Ritterband et al., 2017; Vedaa et al., 2020), waitlist (Zachariae et al., 2018) and usual care (Freeman et al., 2017) in a range of clinical and co-morbid populations."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,34,"Several meta-analyses report large between-group effects on insomnia severity, and medium effects on sleep diary outcomes (Seyffert et al., 2016; Soh et al., 2020; Zachariae et al., 2016), and benefits to sleep are durable, being maintained up to a year and beyond (Blom et al., 2017; Luik et al., 2020; Vedaa et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,35,"Whereas meta-analyses report effect sizes in the range of face-to-face CBT-| thereby suggesting non-inferi- ority, head-to-head comparisons have shown mixed findings (Blom et al., 2015; De Bruin et al., 2016; Kallestad et al., 2021; Lancee et al., 2016)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,36,"It seems likely, however, that the evolution of highly engaging clinically evidenced software will address engagement and treatment implementation challenges that are apparent for all forms of CBT-I delivery."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,7,37,"It may also be the case that differences exist between different digital CBT-I formats (Hasan et al., 2022)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,21,"From a scientific perspective, digital CBT-I confers advantages such that it permits examination of potential mediators of treatment effects using a standardized therapeutic approach."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,22,"Large randomized-controlled trials and secondary analyses show that insom- nia symptom reduction mediates improvements in mental health symptoms (Freeman et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2021), and improve- ments in quality of life, health and wellbeing, and cognitive function (Espie et al., 2019; Kyle, Hurry, et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,23,This evidence therefore supports treating insomnia complaints whenever it presents.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,24,"Emerging data also suggest that demographic variables including age, race, gen- der or socio-economic status do not moderate the effectiveness of digital CBT-I (Cheng et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,25,Real-world evidence further underscores the value of digital CBT-I.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,26,"Recent uncontrolled data evaluating digital CBT-I in existing healthcare settings in the UK show reductions in insomnia and aug- mentation of the effects of in-person therapy for anxiety and depres- sion (Cliffe et al., 2020; Luik et al."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,27,"2017; Stott et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,28,"Importantly, from a health economic perspective, analyses suggest that digital CBT-I is cost-effective, and may lead to cost savings if made available at scale (Darden et al., 2021; Sampson et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,29,This growing body of evidence behind digital CBT-| has led to increased recognition of it as a viable and effective treatment option.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,30,"Indeed, in the USA, Somryst has been cleared by the FDA as a pre- scription digital therapeutic (Morin, 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,31,"Likewise, Sleepio (www."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,32,"sleepio.com) is widely available in the USA, integrated into healthcare  pathways and on the digital formulary, and is available in major parts of the UK National Health Service."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,33,"By overcoming the barriers preventing access to therapist- delivered CBT-I, digital CBT-I has the potential to provide access to clinically effective, evidenced-based and guideline-recommended insomnia treatment."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,34,"These fundamental properties of effectiveness and scalability make digital CBT-I attractive as a first-line insomnia interven- tion, providing an accessible alternative to pharmacotherapy (Figure 4)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,35,"The stepped-care model is a population health service approach to providing people with insomnia with access to evidence-based care (Espie, 2009; Espie et al., 2013)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,36,"Stepped care is often conceptualized as a pyramid consisting of different levels, with at the bottom the least specialized help applicable for those with less severe and more generic complaints and highly specialized help for those with more severe, complex and rare problems as the top."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,37,The level of interven- tion is naturally not arbitrary; treatment is tailored to and based on the needs of the patient and the nature of their complaints.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,38,"The num- ber of steps in any stepped care model would be determined by the levels of intervention that are proven and available, and by what within the healthcare system would be affordable."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,8,39,"Stepped care models have been recommended for use in insomnia (Baglioni et al., 2020, 2022), and are sometimes adopted in healthcare systems (Vincent & Walsh, 2013)."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,2,"Digital CBT offers accessible treatment for all, but also may be integrated into the care pyramid supporting in-person therapy."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,3,"The stepped care model conserves  expert resources for more complex and treatment-resistant cases  of insomnia, as it has considerable “scalability”, particularly when fully automated."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,4,"Another approach at this level might be using self-help books of good standing, perhaps as part of a “books on prescription” scheme."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,5,"Next in the hierarchy might be insomnia services that require some in-person support, but thought would be given to how such care could be provided with efficiency."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,6,"Examples here might include telehealth rather than in a clinic, and the use of small group therapy rather than individual treatment."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,7,Other factors to be considered would be the nature of the treatment itself and the expertise of the therapist.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,8,"For example, it could be possible to train healthcare workers in the provision of manualized CBT-I without them having to have a deep understanding of sleep medicine or mental health (training pri- mary care nurses, for example)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,9,"This approach is very protocol-driven and can be readily standardized (Kyle, Madigan, et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,10,As you then continue up the hierarchy there is greater need for insomnia- specific expertise and for the use of tailored therapy.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,11,At the peak of the pyramid the likelihood is that not only specialist expertise but also specialized facilities such as those available at a sleep centre may be required to address the needs of the most complex patients.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,12,Stepped care systems require decision algorithms for two pro- cesses.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,13,"First, to ensure that people are correctly allocated to the appropriate level of care in the first instance; and secondly, to ensure that people are able to step up to more advanced care depending on their treatment response."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,14,"5 | FUTURE PERSPECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO DIAGNOSIS, MEASUREMENT, AETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; NEW TREATMENTS  Given the drastic changes we have been witnessing concerning insomnia and its diagnosis, pathophysiology/aetiology and treatment in the last 30 years, one might be tempted to answer the question “Can we rest yet?” (Harvey & Tang, 2003) with “Yes!.” However, this would be premature and inadequate with respect to the many open questions still facing us in the insomnia field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,15,"Therefore, at this point, we would like to highlight some issues/avenues for future research and clinical practice we consider of utmost importance."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,16,"Given the fact that at present we have reached the unique situa- tion that all major diagnostic systems (DSM-5, ICSD-3, ICD-11) have agreed upon ID (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014; Ameri- can Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 2019), the situation seems ideal that all types of studies into ID use more or less the same diagnostic criteria, which would be ideal to make data coming from all over the world easily comparable."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,17,"This would also entail homogenization of our diagnostic and research instruments (questionnaires, PSG, etc.)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,9,18,"However, as mentioned before, there defi- nitely are different insomnia phenotypes that should not be neglected."

Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,1,"phenotypes seems warranted (Blanken, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Kao et al., 2021), possibly further refined by adding physiological data by means of PSG to questionnaire datasets."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,2,"In this regard, pooling data from different sleep labs could be ben- eficial in order to address the issues of small sample sizes and poor replicability in the insomnia field."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,3,This would require the use of stan- dard methodology and paradigms across different labs.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,4,"The UK Bio- bank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk; see Allen et al., 2014 for a detailed description), a large biomedical database including a sample of about 500,000 adults, has already proven to be useful for insomnia research (Uansen et al., 2019; Kyle et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,5,"Although the UK Biobank is not specifically optimized for insomnia research, cross- validation showed the available phenotype to very accurately match diagnosed insomnia patients (Hammerschlag et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,6,"Given the costs and artificiality of the traditional sleep laboratory, home-based easy to apply measures need to be developed, allowing repetitive CNS-based measurements in the natural environments of our patients, reaching beyond actigraphy (Debener et al., 2015; Mikkelsen et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,7,This would allow to study the dynamics of fea- tures reflecting the sleep drive and REM sleep characteristics longitu- dinally and in relation to different treatments and their outcomes in much more detail.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,8,"Given the prominence of the hyperarousal concept in almost all insomnia models, one should also start to think about developing a hyperarousal test, which at best could be applied during daytime or rou- tine office/hospital hours."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,9,"One could think about a stress/challenge par- adigm, measuring autonomous nervous system activity (e.g."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,10,"heart rate, galvanic skin response, etc."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,11,"), cortisol as main marker of the stress response and EEG during baseline, rest and different stress conditions."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,12,"One of the best accepted stress paradigms now is the Trier social stress test—its usefulness has already been tested (Chen et al., 2017)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,13,"Alterna- tively, probably just the instruction “please try to sleep now” probably might offset a marked stress response in insomniacs."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,14,"Such a psycho- physiological paradigm administered during the day can also easily be coupled with neuroimaging methods, that is, functional magnetic reso- nance imaging."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,15,"Needless to say, these data should be coupled with descriptive questionnaire data."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,16,"Assuming that it will be possible to develop an easy to apply and valid hyperarousal test, this instrument could be used for phenotyping, relating the data to (epi-)genetic data, general diagnostics, differential-therapeutics and therapy outcomes."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,17,"Given the emerging evidence of maladaptive sleep (Van Someren, 2021), essential insights could require repeated assessment of hyperarousal from evening to morning across recorded nights."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,18,"Analyses can then address which sleep features determine the overnight fate of distress—which could range from full adaptation even to maladaptive sensitization (Wassing, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Wassing, Lakbila-Kamal, et al, 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,19,"Nevertheless, deeper insights into the mechanisms of hyperarousal in insomnia, its causes and consequences for cognitive processes and brain health in general are needed."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,20,This will help to fur- ther increase the value of the hyperarousal concept for insomnia research and could also help to identify a valid hyperarousal test.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,21,"Interestingly, also with therapeutics at present we have reached a  unique situation concerning treatment—all presently published  ai 11 of 18  relevant guidelines agree that CBT-I should be the first-line treatment     for insomnia."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,22,A statement like this would have caused a lot of many raised eyebrows even just 10 years ago!
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,23,"This development is probably because on one hand, the CBT-I literature is blooming and has gener- ated a solid and ever-increasing evidence base, but on the other hand maybe also due to a stagnation in the sector of hypnotic development and the withdrawal of many major players in psychopharmacology from CNS-oriented Research & Development."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,24,It has to be judged in the next few years whether the worldwide introduction of orexin receptor antagonists will markedly alter the hypnotic market.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,25,"From a future perspective, we would like to suggest that research into the roles of histamine and noradrenaline and sleep regulation could lead to new discoveries (Thakkar, 2011; Van Someren, 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,26,"Maybe also approaches encompassing non-invasive brain stimulation might com- plement insomnia treatment strategies (Herrero Babiloni et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,27,"A better understanding of the psychoneurobiological mechanisms of insomnia is urgently needed to monitor and evaluate treatment effects of CBT-I beyond subjective measures, and further develop complementary treatment strategies."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,28,"First, preliminary findings sug- gest that 1 night of experimental sleep restriction (delaying bedtime by 2 hr) may help to stabilize restless REM sleep (Kao et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,29,"However, it remains to be seen whether this stabilization is observed in therapeutic SRT, and whether it translates into improvements in regulation of emotional distress, hyperarousal and the risk of develop- ing mental disorders."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,30,"Second, notwithstanding the established efficacy of CBT-lI, it is important to acknowledge that two out of five patients do not show full remission, even after boosting CBT-I effects with subsequent pharmacological treatment (Morin et al., 2020)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,31,We still have very limited insight into who will respond and who will not.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,32,"Novel graph theory-based analyses like network outcome analysis and network intervention analysis may reveal how non-responders differ in their initial symptom profiles and trajectories of change of symp- toms during the intervention (Blanken, Benjamins, et al., 2019; Blanken et al., 2020; Blanken, van der Zweerde, et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,33,Pinpointing such differences could provide leads to novel strategies.
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,34,"Also the gradual wearing off of initial benefits of CBT-I deserves attention (van der Zweerde et al., 2019)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,35,"Two recent studies indicate that beneficial effects of CBT-I may be preserved longer if CBT-I is combined with interventions aimed at supporting circadian rhythms (Dekker et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2021)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,36,"What we consider probably the most important challenge for the future is the integration of CBT-I into the standard treatment of patients with mental disorders, especially anxiety and depression."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,37,"It is known that almost all mental disorders are afflicted with disturbances of sleep continuity (Baglioni et al., 2016), and we also know that pay- ing proper therapeutic respect to including insomnia-related compo- nents into the overall therapeutic concept will improve outcomes in general and speed up the therapeutic process (Gee et al., 2019; Hertenstein et al., 2022; Manber et al., 2008)."
Insomnia disorder  State of the science and challenges for the future,10,38,"Models how to do this have been suggested by several authors (Kraepelien et al., 2022; Schneider et al., 2020)—thus, the times seem right to postulate insom- nia as a transdiagnostic mechanism for mental disorders (Harvey et al., 2011, 2021; Van Someren, 2021) and also insomnia treatment     wos} PapHO[UMOG ""F “ZZOZ “698TSIEL     LOT opywos:Kaptav-Kreaquyar     -IGET OUNTUG APTENY “FOIE     g S 8 § 2 & 5     puoo-pur-suus9} (1109      jn x0y Aaeaqny auyUG A2qtyy     8 & < ° 2 3 ="
